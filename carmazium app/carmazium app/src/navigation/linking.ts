/**
 * React Navigation linking config (AUTH-020).
 *
 * `NavigationContainer` was previously mounted with `ref` and `theme` only — no
 * `linking` prop at all — so React Navigation never routed an inbound URL.
 * Every deep link was handled by one ad-hoc `expo-linking` listener in
 * `App.tsx` that matched Supabase auth tokens and nothing else, which is why
 * the dealer-staff invite needed a paste-the-link workaround (AUTH-030) and why
 * the OAuth return leg could never be traced end to end (AUTH-003).
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 * 1. **It does not handle the Supabase auth callback.** Those URLs carry tokens
 *    in a hash fragment or a `?code=`, need `setSession`/`exchangeCodeForSession`
 *    before any navigation makes sense, and have their own ordered branch list
 *    (AUTH-019). `App.tsx`'s listener keeps that job; `filter` below excludes
 *    those URLs so the two never both act on one link.
 *
 * 2. **It does not add `https://` support on its own.** `app.json` needs
 *    Android `data.host`/`pathPrefix` entries and iOS `associatedDomains`, plus
 *    an `apple-app-site-association` / `assetlinks.json` served from the domain,
 *    before `https://carmazium.com/...` opens the app. The Android intent filter
 *    is added here; **the iOS half and the server-side association files are
 *    not done** — see PROGRESS.md.
