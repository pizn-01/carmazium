Technical Proposal 
Carmazium Platform Rebuild 
1. Overview 
The proposal describes the complete strategy, technical architecture, 
development phases, timeline, and cost consideration for rebuilding 
Carmazium. The project involves from being a no-code MVP to a scalable, 
custom – engineered system capable of supporting a competitive, real-time 
working automotive marketplace. 
The new platform will enable high-concurrency live auctions, secure escrow
based payments, and an AI-powered valuation and discovery engine, 
positioning Carmazium for long-term growth and enterprise-grade reliability. 
2. Executive Summary 
The primary objective is to replatform Carmazium from its existing no-code 
infrastructure to a high-performance, custom-built architecture using Next.js 
and Nest.js. 
Key Objectives 
• Scalability 
Migrate away from no-code constraints to support 100,000+ concurrent 
users with horizontal scalability. 
• Real-Time Performance 
Enable sub-second latency for auctions, bids, and messaging using 
WebSockets and in-memory caching. 
• Security & Compliance 
Ensure FCA-aligned financial flows, GDPR compliance, and secure 
handling of user and payment data. 
• Extensibility 
Build a modular system that allows future expansion (dealer portals, 
mobile apps, analytics, AI upgrades).
