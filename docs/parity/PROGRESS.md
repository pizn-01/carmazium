## Session log

### 2026-08-31 — Scaffold
Created `docs/parity/` with the three persistent artifacts. Mapped the three apps
and their entry points:

- Web: `src/` — Next.js 16 App Router, entry `src/app/layout.tsx`
- API: `backend/src/` — NestJS + Prisma, entry `backend/src/main.ts`
- Mobile: `carmazium app/carmazium app/` — Expo 54 + React Navigation 7,
  entry `App.tsx` -> `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`

**Next session should pick up:** Pass 1 — AUTH.  _(done — see below)_

### 2026-08-31 — Pass 1: AUTH

**Method.** Read the web + backend implementation first to establish the contract, then read
mobile and diffed against it. Every citation written into the matrix was re-read directly
before being recorded.

**Scope covered.**
- Web: `src/app/auth/{login,signup,callback,forgot-password,reset-password,onboarding,accept-invite,partners}/page.tsx`, `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, `src/lib/{supabase,apiClient}.ts`, `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/DeleteAccountSection.tsx`
- Backend: `backend/src/auth/{auth.controller,auth.service}.ts`, `backend/src/auth/guards/*`, `backend/src/users/{users.controller,users.service}.ts`, `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (UserRole), `backend/src/main.ts` (session + pipe config)
- Mobile: `App.tsx`, `src/navigation/*`, `src/store/authStore.ts`, `src/lib/{supabase,apiClient}.ts`, `src/screens/auth/*`, `src/screens/onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/main/AcceptInviteScreen.tsx`, `app.json`

**Result: 36 rows, AUTH-001 through AUTH-036.**

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| MISSING | 9 |
| PARTIAL | 8 |
| DIVERGENT | 8 |
| PRESENT | 11 |

P0 rows: AUTH-005 (no role selection at signup), AUTH-013 (no global `onAuthStateChange`),
AUTH-014 (401 never navigates), AUTH-019 (callback handles 2 of 7 branches),
AUTH-020 (no React Navigation linking config), AUTH-026 (7 backend roles collapsed to 3).

**The structural finding.** AUTH-020 is the root of several other rows. Mobile has no
`linking` config on `NavigationContainer` (`App.tsx:254-262`) — all deep-link handling is
an ad-hoc `expo-linking` listener that only matches Supabase auth tokens
(`App.tsx:193-234`). This is why the invite flow needs a paste-the-link workaround
(AUTH-030) and why the OAuth return leg could not be traced end to end (AUTH-003).
Any later pass needing an inbound URL to reach a screen will hit the same wall.

**Not traced — stated explicitly rather than assumed.**
- `ChatContext` was not read; it is referenced in `apiClient.ts` comments as an
  `AUTH_REDIRECT` / `NO_SESSION` caller, so the claim in AUTH-014 is scoped to
  "no handler in `App.tsx`, `RootNavigator.tsx`, or `authStore.ts`" — not "none anywhere".
- The OAuth return leg (AUTH-003) is not traced past `Linking.openURL`.
- Web role gating: the central gates were read, not all files matching the role grep.
- Per-screen contents of the 9 dealer-gated screens (AUTH-028) — gating shape only.
- `screens/main/{Finance,Services}Screen.tsx` (AUTH-029) — named but not read.
- AUTH-023, AUTH-035 and OQ-3 describe interactions I reasoned about from code but did
  **not** run. They are marked as needing device verification and are not asserted as bugs.

**Open questions raised: OQ-1 through OQ-8.** OQ-1 (canonical signup role behaviour) and
OQ-5 (are ADMIN/partner roles in scope for mobile at all) gate the largest chunk of Phase 2
scope — answering those two first will settle roughly a third of these rows.

**Docs-only commit. No source files were modified.**

**Next session should pick up:** Pass 2 — BUY.  _(done — see below)_

### 2026-08-31 — Pass 2: BUY

**Method.** Read web + backend first to establish the contract, then mobile, then diffed.
Every citation recorded in the matrix was re-read directly before being written.

**Scope covered.**
- Web: `src/app/search/page.tsx`, `src/app/buy-cars/[slug]/{page,VehicleDetailsPageClient}.tsx`, `src/app/vehicle/[id]/{page,VehicleDetailPageClient}.tsx`, `src/app/compare/page.tsx`, `src/app/checkout/{page,success/page,cancel/page}.tsx`, `src/app/auctions/page.tsx`, `src/app/HomeClient.tsx`, `src/lib/listingApi.ts`, `src/components/features/CarCard.tsx`
- Backend: `listings`, `watchlist`, `offers`, `transactions`, `payments`, `delivery`, `hpi` controllers + DTOs; `schema.prisma` (`Listing`, `ListingType`, `ListingStatus`, `Offer`, `Transaction`, `WatchlistItem`, `TransmissionType`)
- Mobile: `screens/main/{Search,Home,Compare,Saved,Watchlist,PurchaseFlow}Screen.tsx`, `screens/vehicle/VehicleDetailScreen.tsx`, `screens/buyer/{BuyerOffers,BuyerPurchaseHistory}Screen.tsx`, `lib/{listingsApi,watchlistApi,paymentsApi}.ts`, `store/watchlistStore.ts`

**Result: 32 rows, BUY-001 through BUY-032.**

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| MISSING | 2 |
| PARTIAL | 9 |
| DIVERGENT | 8 |
| PRESENT | 10 |
| NEEDS_VERIFICATION | 3 |

**The headline correction to expectations.** Mobile browse/search is *not* materially behind
web. `buildParams` sends 31 of the backend's 38 filter params (`SearchScreen.tsx:280-328`),
and the four omitted are two deprecated aliases, one dead param, and `markedForExport`.
Mobile also *beats* web in three places: debounced search (BUY-003), buyer counter-offers on
the canonical path (BUY-024), and focus-based refresh (BUY-026). Prioritise the specific
value-level defects below over any general "port the search screen" effort.

**P0 rows — all three are correctness defects, not missing features.**
- **BUY-022** — mobile's offer floor is an absolute `price - 15000` (`VehicleDetailScreen.tsx:317`)
  where the backend enforces proportional `floor(price * 0.7)` (`offers.service.ts:53-64`) and
  web mirrors it correctly. Diverges in both directions depending on vehicle price.
- **BUY-006** — mobile sends `SEMI_AUTO`, not a member of `TransmissionType`
  (`schema.prisma:49-56`); the DTO lacks a per-item `@IsEnum` so it reaches Prisma unchecked.
  `CVT` is missing from mobile entirely. Outcome unrun — see OQ-12.
- **BUY-017** — mobile's `handleCardPress` opens every search result in the retail detail
  screen regardless of type (`SearchScreen.tsx:223-226`), so auction results from a
  `listingType=AUCTION` search land on the wrong screen.

**Dead code found.** `WatchlistScreen.tsx` is registered (`MainStackNavigator.tsx:321`) but
`grep -rn "navigate('Watchlist'" src/` returns 0 matches — unreachable, duplicating
`SavedScreen` (BUY-021).

**Not traced — stated rather than assumed.**
- `VehicleDetailScreen.tsx` is 3570 lines; only the sections cited in BUY-013 were read.
  BUY-015 (video embeds) and BUY-016 (damage / 3D viewer) are `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` because I
  could not confirm presence *or* absence — they are explicitly **not** recorded as gaps.
- `HorizontalVehicleCard.tsx` read only to L90 of 286, so BUY-017 cannot fully exclude an
  internal redirect — though `handleCardPress` itself has no type branch.
- `PaymentsService` internals: all payments responses are `any` in the controller, so
  Transaction status transitions (BUY-030) are traced only as far as the controller.
- Web's retail-checkout deadness (BUY-029) rests on a grep, not proof — a runtime-built URL
  could evade it.
- `AuctionDetailScreen.tsx` deliberately deferred to Pass 4 (BUY-018).

**Open questions raised: OQ-9 through OQ-12.** OQ-11 (which web detail page is the porting
source of truth) should be answered before any Phase 2 detail-screen work — the legacy route
contains simulated bidding UI that must not be ported.

**Docs-only commit. No source files were modified.**

**Next session should pick up:** Pass 3 — SELL.  _(done — see below)_

### 2026-08-31 — Pass 3: SELL

**Method.** Read web + backend first to establish the contract, then mobile, then diffed.
Every citation recorded in the matrix was re-read directly before being written.

**Scope covered.**
- Web: `src/app/sell/{page,layout}.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/{seller,dealer}/add-listing/page.tsx`,
  `src/components/listing/{ListingWizard,ImageUpload}.tsx`, `src/components/dealer/DealerQuickList.tsx`,
  `src/app/dashboard/dealer/{inventory,put-on-auction}/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/dashboard/seller/{listings,auctions}/page.tsx`, `src/lib/{listingApi,dvlaApi}.ts`
- Backend: `listings/dto/*` (full `CreateListingDto`), `listings.service.ts` (create, update,
  publish, updateStatus, recordSale, remove, alsoListRetail, alsoAuction, importFromUrl),
  `featured-boost/`, `dvla/`, `damage/`, `payments.service.ts` (tier pricing), `schema.prisma` enums
- Mobile: `screens/sell/{SellCarFlow,MyListingDashboard}Screen.tsx`,
  `screens/seller/{SellerListings,SellerAuctions,SellerDashboard}Screen.tsx`,
  `lib/{sellWizardStore,listingsApi,paymentsApi,storageHelper}.ts`

**Result: 32 rows, SELL-001 through SELL-032.**

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| MISSING | 1 |
| PARTIAL | 5 |
| DIVERGENT | 8 |
| PRESENT | 18 |

**Headline: mobile's sell flow is the strongest area of the app so far** — 18 PRESENT rows.
It mirrors `ListingWizard` closely: full legal declarations, the complete auction schedule step,
correct badge tiers, DVLA autofill, the 3D damage mapper, and the HPI upsell. It *beats* web in
four places: image compression before upload (SELL-008), auto-triggered DVLA lookup (SELL-007),
a Withdraw action web lacks entirely (SELL-023), and using the correct `recordSale` endpoint so
`soldPrice` is actually captured (SELL-024).

**But there is one P0 money defect (SELL-005 / SELL-006).**
The backend requires ≥10 photos to publish (`listings.service.ts:941-945`). Web enforces that
before payment; mobile enforces only ≥1, then charges the card and *then* calls publish
(`SellCarFlowScreen.tsx:1528-1545`). Worse, the failure `catch` does not `return`
(`SellCarFlowScreen.tsx:1544-1557`) — so after a failed publish the seller sees "Almost there!"
immediately followed by **"Published! / Your listing is now live."**, and `clearDraft()` runs.
Charged, misinformed, draft gone. Mobile's own `SellerListingsScreen.tsx:331-380` already does
this correctly (publish first, pay only if `requiresPayment`), so the fix has a working local
precedent. Options are in OQ-14 — I want your call before touching a payment path.

**Two standing ambiguities resolved by this pass:**
- **Canonical auction duration: 24 hours, hardcoded** — `endTime = startTime + 24h`
  (`listings.service.ts:1229`), display-only on both clients.
- **DVLA endpoint auth: none** — `POST /dvla/lookup` has no `@UseGuards`
  (`backend/src/dvla/dvla.controller.ts:30`); it is a public endpoint.

**Structural finding — web has two create implementations.** `/sell` and the seller dashboard
render `ListingWizard` (3200 lines); `/dashboard/dealer/add-listing` renders `DealerQuickList`
(969 lines) which has no legal declarations, a 1-photo minimum, a hard DVLA gate, and an auction
option that collects no auction fields and never calls `POST /auctions`. Mobile mirrors
`ListingWizard`. OQ-13 asks you to confirm that is the porting source.

**Not traced — stated rather than assumed.**
- `SellerAuctionsScreen.tsx` (2426 lines) was grep-sampled for endpoints only; its handover-proof
  upload, digest/tags and results modal were **not** read. Deferred to Pass 4.
- `SellerDashboardScreen.tsx` (1141 lines) grep-sampled for navigation/API calls only.
- `POST /auctions` (used by both clients' create-auction forms) is in `auctions.service.ts`,
  which was **not** read — so I cannot confirm its validation mirrors `alsoAuction`'s. Pass 4.
- Web's dealer inventory Publish never visibly calls `POST /listings/:id/publish`; whether the
  publish gates run inside the checkout-session handler was not traced.
- Whether the backend accepts `DealerQuickList`'s auction-typed listing with no auction record
  was not verified (OQ-13).
- `IN_PREP` appears in web's `STATUS_COLORS` (`inventory/page.tsx:52`) but is not in the
  `ListingStatus` enum — probably stale, not resolved.

**Open questions raised: OQ-13 through OQ-16** (16 open in total). OQ-14 is the one that needs an
answer before any Phase 2 work on this flow.

**Docs-only commit. No source files were modified.**

**Next session should pick up:** Pass 4 — AUCTION.  _(done — see below)_

### 2026-09-01 — Pass 4: AUCTION

**Method.** Backend contract first, then web UI, then mobile buyer-side and seller-side (split
because mobile's auction surface is ~7,900 lines). Every citation recorded in the matrix was
re-read directly before being written.

**Scope covered.**
- Backend: `auctions/{auctions.controller,auctions.service,auction.gateway}.ts` + dto,
  `bids/{bids.controller,bids.service}.ts` + dto, `tasks/` lifecycle + unpaid-fee crons,
  `schema.prisma` (`Auction`, `Bid`, `AuctionStatus`, `Sale`)
- Web: `src/app/auctions/live/[id]/page.tsx`, `auctions/won/[id]/page.tsx`, `auctions/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/dashboard/seller/auctions/page.tsx`, `src/lib/auctionApi.ts`,
  `src/components/features/CountdownTimer.tsx`, `src/components/auctions/AuctionResultsModal.tsx`
- Mobile: `screens/vehicle/AuctionDetailScreen.tsx`, `screens/main/{Live,AuctionComplete}Screen.tsx`,
  `screens/buyer/BuyerBidsScreen.tsx`, `screens/seller/SellerAuctionsScreen.tsx` (read in full this
  time — Pass 3 had only grep-sampled it), `lib/auctionApi.ts`

**Result: 39 rows, AUC-001 through AUC-039.**

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| MISSING | 3 |
| PARTIAL | 6 |
| DIVERGENT | 9 |
| PRESENT | 21 |

**Headline: real-time bidding is at genuine parity.** Both clients connect to the same
`/auctions` socket namespace, handle all six server events, emit only `auction:join`, place bids
over REST, and apply anti-snipe `newEndTime` identically. Mobile is *ahead* on five counts:
min-increment pre-validation (AUC-010), gating the bid console on KYC verification and not just
role (AUC-011), status tabs on the seller list (AUC-026), 70% starting-bid pre-validation
(AUC-032), and a webhook-confirmation poll after fee payment that web lacks (AUC-021).

**One P0 (AUC-029) — mobile carries a bug web already fixed.**
An auction ending below reserve reverts its listing to DRAFT so it can be re-auctioned
(`auctions.service.ts:845-872`). Web's eligibility filter explicitly admits that DRAFT when an
ENDED auction exists for the listing (`dashboard/seller/auctions/page.tsx:212-218`) — and its code
comment states that without it "re-auctioning was silently impossible for every seller". Mobile
still uses the pre-fix `status === 'ACTIVE'` filter (`SellerAuctionsScreen.tsx:631`), so the
reverted listing never matches `presetListingId` and never appears in the picker. The mobile
"Re-auction" button fails for the exact case it exists to serve. The fix is known and documented
in web's comment.

**Three P1s.** AUC-012 — mobile renders competing bidders' full names where web shows initials
only, and is internally inconsistent since socket-delivered bids carry only initials (OQ-18).
AUC-022 — mobile shows a 24h payment deadline from two different computations while the backend
grace period is 72h (OQ-20). AUC-025 — mobile has no Stripe Connect payout warning, so a seller
can complete a handover with no payout destination configured.

**Ambiguity resolved:** canonical auction duration is **24 hours** (`auctions.service.ts:19`),
anti-snipe **3 minutes, repeating, uncapped** (`:20,751-769`), buyer-fee grace **72 hours**
(`:23`). Note `create-auction.dto.ts:10` and `auctions.controller.ts:99` both still say
"startTime + 5 hours" — stale docs, logged as AUC-039.

**Two web-side defects logged so mobile does not copy them:** AUC-008, where
`isAntiSnipeActive()` uses a 10-minute window (`src/lib/auctionApi.ts:268-272`) driving the browse
page's SNIPE badge while the real rule is 3 minutes; and web's missing min-increment and 70%
client validations (AUC-010, AUC-032).

**Not traced — stated rather than assumed.**
- The £125 buyer-fee and £100 seller-bonus *release* endpoints are not in the auctions or bids
  modules; `buyerFeePaid` and `sellerBonusReleased` are read but never written there. They live in
  the payments module and/or an admin module, neither of which was read.
- `adminAssignWinner` (`auctions.service.ts:581-608`) is not wired to any route in
  `auctions.controller.ts`; its caller was not read.
- Whether the backend rejects a duplicate also-list-retail call (AUC-035) was not verified.
- OQ-19 (reserve on the wire) is a reading of `findOne`, not a request I executed.

**Open questions raised: OQ-17 through OQ-20** (20 open in total).

**Docs-only commit. No source files were modified.**

**Next session should pick up:** Pass 5 — DASHBOARDS.  _(done — see below)_

### 2026-09-01 — Pass 5: DASHBOARDS (including Dealer, per request)

**Method.** Backend contracts first, then web buyer/seller, web dealer, mobile buyer/seller, and
mobile dealer — five parallel reads, since the surface is roughly 20k lines. Every citation
recorded in the matrix was re-read directly before being written.

**Scope covered.**
- Backend: `dashboard/`, `notifications/` (+ gateway), `chat/` (+ gateway), `sellers/`, `dealers/`
  controllers and DTOs; `schema.prisma` (`Notification`, `ChatRoom`, `Message`, `DealerProfile`,
  `DealerStaff`, `DealerRole`, `SellerProfile`, `SellerReview`, `Lead`, `LeadStatus`)
- Web: `dashboard/{layout,page}.tsx`, `dashboard/user/page.tsx`, `dashboard/buyer/**`,
  `dashboard/seller/{page,earnings,performance,offers,settings}`, all 13 `dashboard/dealer/**`
  pages incl. `layout.tsx`, `DashboardSidebar.tsx`, `ProfileCompletionGate.tsx`,
  `config/dealerRouteConfig.ts`
- Mobile: `UnifiedDashboardScreen`, `Buyer{Dashboard,PurchaseHistory}Screen`,
  `Seller{Dashboard,Performance,Offers,Profile}Screen`, `EarningsScreen`,
  `Notifications{,Settings}Screen`, `MessagesScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, `PaymentHistoryScreen`,
  `ChatContext`, `notificationsApi`, all 11 `Dealer*Screen`s, `DealerGate`, `GlobalDrawer`

**Result: 47 rows, DASH-001 through DASH-047.**

| PRESENT | 25 |

**The finding that reframes this pass: web has two dashboards, and users reach only one.**
`/dashboard` sends buyers and sellers to `/dashboard/user`, a tab-driven page, and the sidebar
links nowhere else except `/dashboard/seller/auctions`. But nine fully-built standalone pages
still exist unlinked — and several are **better** than the live tabs (period toggle, auction
bonuses in earnings, delivery requests inside offers, cancel-and-relist, purchase history).
Crucially, **mobile has implemented four features that exist only on those orphaned pages**, so
mobile currently matches the unreachable web app in those places. OQ-21 asks which is canonical;
it decides whether four mobile rows read as "ahead", "correct", or "built against dead code".

**Mobile is strong here — 25 PRESENT — and ahead of web in six places:** the 7d/30d period
toggle on the live path (DASH-005), working notification preferences the backend actually honours
while web's toggles save nothing (DASH-021, OQ-24), the fullest use of `RecordSaleDto` anywhere
(DASH-015), trader address verification with no web UI at all (DASH-031), dealer payouts and bank
details which the web dealer dashboard entirely lacks (DASH-042), and an honest read-only finance
screen instead of web's dead Approve/Reject buttons referencing non-existent statuses (DASH-043).

**Six MISSING rows.** DASH-030 account deletion (re-confirms AUTH-033 — grep across mobile `src/`
returns zero matches; app-store relevant). DASH-003 profile completion gate. DASH-023 chat
presence — the gateway broadcasts `presence:snapshot` and `presence:update` and web consumes both,
mobile handles neither. DASH-024 contact support — `POST /chat/support` exists and web has a
sidebar button; grep for `chat/support` in mobile returns zero. DASH-010 auction bonuses in
earnings. DASH-046 partner/admin dashboards (duplicate of AUTH-029, blocked on OQ-5).

**Dealer dashboard specifically** (added at your request) is at close parity. The open question
from the mapping is answered: **`DealerLeadsScreen` *is* mobile's CRM** — its own comment says the
board mirrors web's CRM stage set, same six stages and endpoints, tap-based rather than
drag-and-drop, plus a List view web lacks (DASH-037). Gaps are narrower than expected: analytics
is missing four breakdowns and CSV export (DASH-036), and the home KPI tiles differ (DASH-035).

**Web-side defects logged so they are not ported:** the dealer earnings "Financial Report" button
has no `onClick` (DASH-044); web's `denied` handover stage is unreachable because `stageFor()`
never returns it (DASH-045); web's notification toggles save nothing (DASH-021).

**Not traced — stated rather than assumed.**
- `dealers.service.ts` bodies for `getStats`/`getAnalytics`/`getLeads`/`inviteStaff` were not read
  in full, so exact response field names for `/dealers/stats` and `/dealers/analytics` are
  unverified, and OQ-23's "roles are not enforced" is scoped to what I read.
- `sellers.service.ts` was not read at all.
- Web components `KycOverlayForm`, `ReceiptsTab`, `MetricCard`, `PeriodToggle`,
  `DeleteAccountSection` were referenced but not opened.
- Mobile `ChatScreen.tsx` and `chatApi.ts` were not read, so typing-indicator rendering and the
  exact `/chat/rooms` client contract are unconfirmed.
- `Notification.type` is a plain `String`, not an enum (`schema.prisma:1072`) — the full set of
  type values in use was not enumerated; it would need a grep of every `notificationsService.create`
  call site across all modules.

**Open questions raised: OQ-21 through OQ-24** (24 open in total). OQ-21 should be answered before
any Phase 2 dashboard work.

**Docs-only commit. No source files were modified.**

**Next session should pick up:** Pass 6 — CROSS-CUTTING.  _(done — Phase 1 complete)_
(silent error handling swallowing failures into zero-value dashboards) was observed across every
screen in this pass and should be folded into that sweep.

### 2026-09-01 — Pass 6: CROSS-CUTTING (final audit pass)

**Method.** A survey sweep rather than deep feature reads: shared primitives read in full, then
grep-based pattern counts across all screens/pages, plus a three-way token comparison against the
design system. Counts below are exact grep hits unless marked as estimates. Every load-bearing
claim was re-verified directly before being written.

**Scope covered.**
- Mobile: `components/{GlobalToastProvider,Toast}.tsx`, `components/ui/*`, `lib/apiClient.ts`,
  `constants/{colors,spacing,typography}.ts`, plus pattern surveys across all 60 screens
- Web: `lib/{apiClient,fetchWithRetry}.ts`, `app/{error,global-error,template,layout}.tsx`,
  plus pattern surveys across 98 pages
- Design system: `CarMazium Design System/{README,SKILL,colors_and_type.css}` + `ui_kits/`,
  `THEME_MIGRATION_TODO.md`, web `globals.css`

**Result: 24 rows, CROSS-001 through CROSS-024.**

**Headline: mobile's design-token discipline is the best part of the codebase, and on brand colour
mobile is right where web is wrong.** The design system's `SKILL.md:47` sets a hard rule that the
primary red is `#FF0037`, "not the old `#ED1C24`". Mobile uses `#FF0037` (`colors.ts:39`); web
still uses `#ed1c24` (`globals.css:6`). Same story for the secondary brand colour. Mobile also has
**zero** hardcoded hex in `src/screens/` and **zero** inline `fontSize`/`fontFamily` literals —
web has no shared skeleton or empty-state component at all, and reaches for native
`alert()`/`confirm()` at 74 call sites across 23 files. Several rows here are web defects recorded
specifically so nobody "fixes" mobile toward web (CROSS-001, CROSS-002, CROSS-008, CROSS-010).

**Where mobile genuinely needs work:**
- **CROSS-023 (P2, highest-value fix)** — dashboards `catch { /* show zeros */ }`, so a failed
  request is indistinguishable from real zero data. A dealer whose analytics call fails sees a
  dashboard reporting zero sales and zero revenue with no error shown. The shared `ErrorBanner`
  already exists in 18 screens, so this is mechanical.
- **CROSS-018 (P1)** — only `SearchScreen` paginates. Seven other lists fetch a fixed page-1 limit
  (20-100) and stop silently; a dealer with 60 leads loses 10 with no indication. Web has the same
  problem on 10 pages, so it is not a mobile regression.
- **CROSS-015 (P1)** — no offline detection on either app, but it bites mobile harder: no
  reachability branch in `apiClient`, a shorter 10s timeout than web's 30s, and no retry wrapper
  where web at least hardened its auth cold-start path with `fetchWithRetry`.
- **CROSS-009 (P2)** — `Alert.alert` at 173 call sites vs `ErrorBanner` in 18 screens, with 13
  screens using both and no rule distinguishing them.

**A Pass 5 row was corrected.** CROSS-021 found `BuyerDashboardScreen.tsx` (624 lines) is
unreachable dead code — zero `navigate()` call sites, absent from the drawer's 33 `stackScreen`
targets. It holds the richer buyer tile set and a period toggle that the live
`UnifiedDashboardScreen` lacks. **DASH-004 has been amended** to say so. Note the subtlety that
made this worth double-checking: `UnifiedDashboardScreen`'s stack route is *also* never navigated
to, yet its component is live because `TabNavigator.tsx:29` renders it directly — route-deadness
and screen-deadness are different things, and a naive grep would have called both dead.

**Also corrected during this pass:** the mobile agent reported `Earnings` as possibly unreachable.
It is not — `GlobalDrawer.tsx` navigates via `navigation.navigate('Main', { screen: item.stackScreen })`
(`GlobalDrawer.tsx:349`), a variable, so `navigate('Earnings')` greps miss it. All 33 drawer
`stackScreen` values are reachable. Any future dead-screen check must account for that indirection.

**Not traced — stated rather than assumed.**
- CROSS-011: I did not grep mobile for a root React error boundary — marked NEEDS_VERIFICATION
  rather than recorded as a gap.
- CROSS-024: mobile `accessibilityLabel` coverage was not audited at all; the web `aria-label`
  ratio is a rough signal that overstates the issue since visible text also satisfies an
  accessible name. Recorded as a known-unaudited area.
- Empty-state adoption on mobile is a component-import count (26 screens), not a per-screen
  confirmation that every list has one.
- The design system's `ui_kits/carmazium-mobile/` has no manifest file, so mobile's documented
  claim that its deeper ground colour `#0A0D14` "comes from the design system's mobile kit"
  (`colors.ts:24-27`) could not be verified against that kit's source.
- Haptics adoption (15 of 60 screens) was counted by import, not by auditing every primary action.

**Open questions raised: OQ-25 through OQ-29** (29 open in total).

**Docs-only commit. No source files were modified.**

## Phase 1 complete

All six audit passes are done: **210 rows** across AUTH (36), BUY (32), SELL (32), AUCTION (39),
DASH (47) and CROSS (24), with 29 open questions. No source file has been modified in Phase 1.

**Next session:** Phase 2 Flow 1 — Listing publish payment path (SELL-005, SELL-006). All 29 open questions answered 2026-09-01; see the Decisions Log in OPEN-QUESTIONS.md and the prioritised plan below.
session on `parity/<flow-name>`, starting only once rows are confirmed and prioritised.

## Phase 2 plan — prioritised 2026-09-01

All 29 open questions are answered (see the Decisions Log in `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`). Six rows are
now **out of scope**: AUTH-027, AUTH-029, AUTH-031, BUY-029, DASH-046 (partner/admin roles,
dead partners portal, off-platform retail checkout).

**Nothing below has been built yet. Phase 1 was docs-only — no mobile source file has been
modified. An APK built from this commit contains the app exactly as it was before the audit.**

Phase 2 rule stands: **one flow per session**, on `parity/<flow-name>`, and I restate the row IDs
in scope and get confirmation before writing code.

### Suggested order

**Flow 1 — Listing publish payment path (P0, money).**
Rows: SELL-005, SELL-006. Enforce ≥10 photos at the mobile Media step, fix the missing `return`
in the failure `catch` (which currently shows a false "Published!" after a failed publish), then
restructure create to publish-first-pay-second as `SellerListingsScreen` already does. Highest
priority because sellers are being charged for listings that do not publish.

**Flow 2 — Auction correctness (P0/P1).**
Rows: AUC-029 (re-auction filter admits the reverted DRAFT — the fix is already written down in
web's own code comment), AUC-012 (initials only), AUC-022 (72h deadline, real value passed from
both entry points), AUC-017 (refetch on socket reconnect).

**Flow 3 — Search and offer contract fixes (P0/P1).**
Rows: BUY-022 (replace the absolute `price - 15000` offer floor with the backend's proportional
70%), BUY-006 (`SEMI_AUTO` → `SEMI_AUTOMATIC`, add `CVT`), BUY-017 (route AUCTION search results
to `LiveAuctionDetailed`), BUY-007/BUY-008 (make list, condition values).

**Flow 4 — Session and auth (P0).**
Rows: AUTH-005 (signup role picker, BUYER + DEALER only), AUTH-013 (global `onAuthStateChange`),
AUTH-014 + OQ-6 (store-level `forceLogout()` on `AUTH_REDIRECT`), AUTH-034 (preserve destination
through re-login), AUTH-035 (cold-start gate), AUTH-003/OQ-3 (separate the onboarding flags).

**Flow 5 — Deep linking (P0, structural).**
Rows: AUTH-020, AUTH-019, AUTH-030, AUTH-003. Add a React Navigation `linking` config. This is
the root cause behind the invite paste-the-link workaround and the untraceable OAuth return leg;
several other rows unblock once it exists.

**Flow 6 — Dashboard error states (P2, one dedicated pass — OQ-26).**
Rows: CROSS-023, DASH-047. Replace `catch { /* show zeros */ }` with the existing shared
`ErrorBanner` plus retry across the dashboard screens, so a failed request stops looking like
genuine zero data.

**Flow 7 — Account and settings gaps (P1).**
Rows: AUTH-033 / DASH-030 (account deletion — app-store relevant), DASH-023 (chat presence),
DASH-024 (contact support), DASH-003 (profile completion gate).

**Flow 8 — Dashboard feature merge (P2, depends on the OQ-21 web merge).**
Rows: DASH-004 + OQ-29 (wire up `BuyerDashboardScreen`, delete `WatchlistScreen`), DASH-010
(auction bonuses in earnings), DASH-005/012 (period toggle, performance metric set).

**Flow 9 — Offline and resilience (P1 — OQ-28).**
Rows: CROSS-015, CROSS-017. NetInfo, offline banner, `OFFLINE` sentinel in `apiClient`. No request
queueing or cached reads without a separate discussion.

**Flow 10 — Pagination (P1 — OQ-27).**
Row: CROSS-018, scoped to dealer inventory, dealer leads and seller listings only. Compare and
dashboard previews stay deliberately capped.

**Small fixes to fold into whichever flow touches that file:**
AUC-016 (the "Adjust Reserve Price" stub that alerts success but makes no API call), AUC-038
(the "Handover confirmed" header contradicting the journey list below it), OQ-9 (remove the £95
`buyerFee` default), AUC-025 (Stripe Connect payout warning), DASH-019/OQ-22 (live notification
list).

### Logged for the web app / backend — not mobile parity work

- Web renders the superseded brand red `#ed1c24`; canonical is `#FF0037` (OQ-25, CROSS-001/002).
- Web's notification preference toggles save nothing (OQ-24, DASH-021).
- Web's password reset enforces 6 characters; canonical is 8 (OQ-2, AUTH-008).
- Web's signup has no terms-acceptance gate; mobile's is correct and stays (OQ-4, AUTH-007).
- `POST /damage/:listingId/save` has no ownership check (OQ-15).
- `reservePrice` is returned to every client by `AuctionsService.findOne` (OQ-19).
- `DealerQuickList` omits all legal declarations and has a broken auction path (OQ-13).
- `/auth/partners` is broken and orphaned; `api-server/` is a stale deployment path (OQ-7, OQ-8).
- Dormant retail-checkout code in both apps should be removed (OQ-10).
- Backend should validate the legal declarations it currently accepts as optional (OQ-16).

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 0: Baseline (2026-09-01)

`docs/parity/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` written and committed (`d0f25149`). Four planning
decisions recorded there as P-1..P-4: branch base is `main`; the near-term APK is side-loaded
so account deletion (Flow 5) moves to last; offline (CROSS-015/017) folds into Flow 6's
prebuild cycle; the dead "Adjust Reserve Price" button is removed, not wired.

Flow order: **0 → 1 → 2a → 2b → 3 → 4 → 6 → 7 → 5.**

**Verification is always a hand-off.** This machine has no Android SDK — `adb` not found,
`ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` both unset, no `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`. Every flow
ends with a manual test script for the owner to run on the build machine.

### Quality-gate baseline — no source files modified

Run from `carmazium app/carmazium app/`.

`npx tsc --noEmit` — **exit 2, 22 errors, all in one file:**

```
src/components/__tests__/VehicleCard.test.tsx — 22 errors
  TS2708 Cannot use namespace 'jest' as a value  (x9)
  TS2582 Cannot find name 'describe' / 'it'      (x6)
  TS2304 Cannot find name 'beforeEach' / 'expect' (x7)
```

Cause: `@types/jest` is not installed, so the test file's globals are untyped. **Zero errors in
`src/screens/`, `src/components/` (non-test), `src/lib/`, `src/store/` or `src/navigation/`.**
Every future flow should reproduce exactly these 22 and nothing else; any additional error is
that flow's own.

`npm run lint` — **exit 1, 25 problems (12 errors, 13 warnings), all pre-existing:**

```
errors (12), all no-restricted-syntax token violations:
  src/constants/spacing.ts:48,55,63,72          raw hex (inside Elevation shadow colours)
  src/components/GradeChip.tsx:9-13             raw hex (x5 — the 5 grade colours, matches CROSS-004)
  src/components/AuctionCardBadges.tsx:102      rgba literal with an existing Colors.*Alpha* token
  src/screens/main/DealerFinanceScreen.tsx:72   rgba literal with an existing token
  src/screens/vehicle/VehicleDetailScreen.tsx:3094  rgba literal with an existing token

warnings (13): unused eslint-disable directives for react-hooks/exhaustive-deps across
  DealerInventoryScreen, DealerOnboardingScreen, SearchScreen (x4), SellerAuctionsScreen,
  SellerDashboardScreen and others.
```

Two notes for later flows. The lint baseline is not clean, so "lint passes" is never the bar —
the bar is *these 25 and no more*. And three of the offending files are ones Phase A opens:
`VehicleDetailScreen` (Flow 3), `SellerAuctionsScreen` (Flow 2a), `SearchScreen` (Flow 3). Per
`CLAUDE.md`'s migrate-when-you-touch rule these are fair to clean up in the flow that opens
them, which would shrink the baseline — say so explicitly when it happens rather than letting
the numbers drift silently.

**Next session:** Flow 1 — `parity/listing-publish-payment` (SELL-005, SELL-006).

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 1: Listing publish payment path (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/listing-publish-payment`, cut from `main` (P-1).
Rows: **SELL-005, SELL-006** → both `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. One new row logged: **SELL-033**.

**Scope confirmed by the repo owner before any code was written**, including two extensions
beyond the two rows: the auction branch's silent publish failure, and a blocking photo counter
on the Media step rather than a bare inline message.

### What was wrong (all re-read in this session, not taken from the matrix)

1. `handlePublish` gated at `allImages.length === 0` while the backend requires 10
   (`listings.service.ts:940-945`). A seller with 1-9 photos reached the Stripe sheet.
2. Order was create → pay → publish. The publish `catch` had **no `return`**, so a failed
   publish fell through to `clearDraft()` and a second alert reading
   "Published! / Your listing is now live."
3. **Found in-session, beyond the matrix:** `publishListing` never returns `activated: true`
   for a DRAFT — every success path sets `PENDING_REVIEW`
   (`listings.service.ts:987-991,1030-1036`). So "Your listing is now live" was false *even
   when nothing failed*. The auction branch had already been corrected for exactly this
   (there is a comment at `SellCarFlowScreen.tsx:1533-1536` saying so); the classified branch
   was left behind.
4. **Also found in-session:** the backend's 10-photo guard runs *before* the
   `badgeTier === 'FREE'` branch (`listings.service.ts:940` vs `:967`), so it applies to
   auctions too. The auction branch swallowed publish failure (`catch {}` — "Non-fatal") and
   then announced "Auction Scheduled!" for an auction that was never submitted for review.

### What changed — `src/screens/sell/SellCarFlowScreen.tsx` only

- `MIN_PHOTOS = 10` (`:64-72`) and a `PublishResult` type mirroring the endpoint (`:74-79`).
- `step2HasErrors()` (`:943-946`) disables Next on the Media step below the minimum, using the
  same shape as the existing `step1HasErrors` / `step3HasErrors` and wired into the same
  footer condition (`:3121,3124`).
- Photo tracker reads `N / 10 MINIMUM` in warning colour while short, and the coaching hint is
  replaced by "Add N more photos to continue" (`:2266-2296`). Two new style entries; no raw
  hex, no inline font sizes.
- `validateStep(2)` blocks as a second path (`:1204-1214`) for draft-resume and hardware-back
  entries that do not go through the footer button.
- `handlePublish`'s own gate moved `=== 0` → `< MIN_PHOTOS` (`:1375-1383`).
- Classified branch restructured to publish-first / pay-only-on `requiresPayment`
  (`:1575-1653`), copied from `SellerListingsScreen.tsx:331-380`. Every failure path returns
  and states the money position explicitly — "You have not been charged" before payment,
  "Your payment went through… you will not be charged twice" after it.
- Success copy is now "Submitted for review", matching what the backend actually did.
- Auction branch surfaces publish failure instead of swallowing it (`:1540-1559`).

**No other file was modified.** No backend change. No new dependency.

### Manual test script

Preconditions: a signed-in seller account, a Stripe test card, and a vehicle draft you are
willing to discard. Auctions are FREE tier, classifieds are paid (BASIC £1 / STANDARD £10 /
PREMIUM £25) — steps 4-8 involve a real test charge.

**A — Photo minimum blocks before any charge (SELL-005)**

1. Start a new listing, complete Step 1 Details, tap **NEXT · MEDIA**.
   *Expect:* Media step. Tracker reads `0 / 10 MINIMUM` in amber. Hint reads "Add 10 more
   photos to continue — listings need 10 to publish." **NEXT · PRICING is greyed out and does
   nothing when tapped.**
2. Add 3 photos.
   *Expect:* tracker `3 / 10 MINIMUM`, hint "Add 7 more photos…". Next still disabled.
3. Add 7 more (10 total).
   *Expect:* tracker flips to `10 / 100` in the normal accent colour, hint reverts to the
   "Aim for at least 20 photos…" coaching line, **Next is enabled.**
4. Add one more photo, then delete photos back down to 9.
   *Expect:* the counter and hint return to the blocking state and Next disables again.

**B — Classified: publish succeeds (SELL-006)**

5. With 10+ photos, complete Pricing (pick BASIC £1), reach Review, tap Publish.
   *Expect:* the Stripe payment sheet appears **only after** a brief publish call — and on a
   listing that meets every requirement it appears normally. Pay with the test card.
   *Expect:* exactly **one** alert, titled **"Submitted for review"**, reading "Your listing
   goes live once our team has reviewed it." **It must not say "now live".** Tap View Listings.
6. In My Listings, find the listing.
   *Expect:* status **PENDING_REVIEW**, not ACTIVE. (There is no PENDING_REVIEW tab on mobile
   yet — SELL-022 — so check the ALL tab.)

**C — Classified: payment cancelled**

7. Start another listing with 10+ photos, reach Publish, and **dismiss the Stripe sheet**.
   *Expect:* one alert, "Payment cancelled — Your listing was saved as a draft. Publish it
   from My Listings to complete payment." **No "Published!" alert follows it.** The draft is
   still in My Listings as DRAFT.

**D — Classified: publish fails after payment (the regression this flow exists to prevent)**

8. Hardest to stage; do it if you can. Force the second publish call to fail — e.g. put the
   device in airplane mode in the moment between paying and the app returning.
   *Expect:* one alert titled **"Payment received — listing not submitted"** which states the
   payment went through and that publishing again will not double-charge.
   **Fail the flow if you see "Published!", "now live", or two alerts in a row.**

**E — Auction path**

9. Create an AUCTION listing with **9** photos.
   *Expect:* blocked at the Media step exactly as in A — the minimum is not classified-only.
10. Create an AUCTION listing with 10+ photos and schedule it.
    *Expect:* no payment sheet (auctions are FREE tier), and one alert
    **"Auction Scheduled!"** → View Auctions shows it.
11. If you can force the auction publish call to fail (airplane mode at the moment of
    scheduling): *expect* **"Auction saved, not yet submitted"**, never "Auction Scheduled!".

**F — Regression sweep**

12. Resume a saved draft from the Media step. *Expect:* the counter reflects the restored photo
    count and Next is disabled if under 10. (Note SELL-020: draft resume only restores 12
    fields, so declarations will need re-entering — that is a known separate gap, not this flow.)
13. Android hardware back from the Media step. *Expect:* steps back one, does not exit the flow.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing was run on a device — this machine has no Android SDK. Every expectation above is
  derived from code read in this session plus the backend contract, not from execution.
- Step D's post-payment failure path is reasoned, not staged; it is the one branch I could not
  exercise even in principle from here.
- `triggerListingFeePayment` internals were not re-read this session; the restructure treats it
  as the unchanged black box it already was.

**Next session:** Flow 2a — `parity/auction-correctness` (AUC-029, AUC-012, AUC-022, AUC-017).

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 2a: Auction correctness (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/auction-correctness`, cut from `main` (P-1).
Rows: **AUC-029, AUC-012, AUC-022, AUC-004/017** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. **AUC-030** folded in.

> Note on branching: this branch was cut from `main` in parallel with Flow 1, so it conflicted
> with it in this file on merge (the matrix auto-merged — different rows, different lines).
> Settled as **P-5**: each flow merges to `main` once verified, and the next is cut from there.
> Flows 1 and 2a were merged to `main` **unverified**, at the repo owner's explicit direction,
> so that Flow 2b had a single base. Both remain `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

### Verified against source this session, not taken from the matrix

- Backend grace is **72h**, and it is measured from **`wonAt`**, not `endTime`
  (`auctions.service.ts:23`, `revertUnpaidWins` `:618-626` filters `wonAt < now - 72h`).
  The matrix said 72h but did not say from what — the distinction decides which client can
  compute the deadline exactly and which can only approximate.
- `wonAt` is set at the moment the auction closes with a winner (`auctions.service.ts:544`),
  which is the same moment the `auction:ended` socket event fires. So the live-win path can
  use `Date.now()` and be exact.
- `GET /bids/my` selects only `id, status, endTime, winnerId, winningBidAmount` from the
  auction (`bids.service.ts:203-211`) — **no `wonAt`**. `BuyerBidsScreen` therefore cannot be
  exact; it approximates off `endTime`. Logged below as a backend item.
- Web renders initials in **both** the avatar and the label (`live/[id]/page.tsx:1360,1362`),
  so mirroring web means the mobile row shows initials in both places too — not a name field
  repointed at initials.
- `PATCH /auctions/:id` accepts updates only while `SCHEDULED` (`auctions.service.ts:434-436`).
  Recorded here because it settles AUC-016 for Flow 2b (P-4).

### Changes

**AUC-029 + AUC-030** — `SellerAuctionsScreen.tsx:626-676`. `openCreateModal` now fetches
`/auctions/my/list` in parallel with `/listings/my` and admits a `DRAFT` listing when an
`ENDED` auction exists against its id, which is what distinguishes a reserve-not-met revert
from an ordinary unfinished draft. Also excludes listings already tied to a SCHEDULED/ACTIVE
auction and any listing carrying a `linkedListingId` (AUC-030 — same filter expression, same
test, so folding it in was cheaper than a second pass over the same function).

**AUC-012** — `name` **removed from `BidEntry`** rather than reassigned (`:50-62`), so the
field that carried the leak no longer exists. Initial-load mapper (`:305-313`), socket mapper
(`:405`) and the row render (`:1403`) all now use `initials` only.

**AUC-022** — shared `AUCTION_PAYMENT_GRACE_MS` in `lib/auctionApi.ts:5-20`. Socket win path
passes `Date.now() + 72h` (exact); `BuyerBidsScreen` passes `endTime + 72h` (approximate, see
above). The 24h mount-time fallback is **deleted**: `timeLeft` became `number | null` and the
countdown block is not rendered when the deadline is unknown, rather than showing an invented
one. Payment stays enabled in that case — refusing a payment on a deadline we do not know
would be worse than showing no timer. Note `timeLeft === 0` in the pay guard is deliberately
an identity check, since `null < 3600` and `!null` both coerce the wrong way.

**AUC-004 / AUC-017** — `AuctionDetailScreen.tsx:396-404`. The `reconnect` handler refetches
alongside re-emitting `auction:join`, which only re-subscribes and replays nothing.
`loadAuction` gained `{ silent: true }` (`:291-297`) so the resync does not blank the live
screen, and is reached via a ref (`:342-350`) so the socket effect keeps its
`[auctionId, currentUser?.id]` deps — `loadAuction` is keyed on the whole `currentUser`
object, and that effect carries a comment recording that object-keying tore the socket down
mid-auction. Also changed the error-state retry from `onPress={loadAuction}` to
`onPress={() => loadAuction()}`, which otherwise passes the press event as the options object.

Five files: `lib/auctionApi.ts`, `screens/vehicle/AuctionDetailScreen.tsx`,
`screens/seller/SellerAuctionsScreen.tsx`, `screens/main/AuctionCompleteScreen.tsx`,
`screens/buyer/BuyerBidsScreen.tsx`. No backend change, no new dependency.

### Manual test script

Needs two accounts: a **verified dealer** who can bid, and a **seller** with an auction.
Several steps need an auction to actually end, so allow for the 24h duration or use a
short-scheduled auction if you can.

**A — Re-auction a reserve-not-met listing (AUC-029, the P0)**

1. As seller, run an auction to completion with **no bid meeting the reserve** (either no bids
   or all below reserve).
   *Expect:* the auction ends; the listing reverts to DRAFT.
2. Open My Auctions, the ended auction, results modal, then **Re-auction**.
   *Expect:* the create-auction sheet opens with **that listing already selected**. Before this
   change it opened showing "no eligible listings" — that is the exact failure being fixed.
3. Complete the form and schedule.
   *Expect:* a new SCHEDULED auction against the same vehicle.

**B — Eligibility exclusions (AUC-030)**

4. With a listing already in a SCHEDULED auction, open Create Auction from the header.
   *Expect:* that listing is **not** in the picker (previously it was, and the server rejected
   it on submit).
5. Take a listing you have also-listed for retail, open the picker.
   *Expect:* not offered.
6. An ordinary DRAFT that has never been auctioned.
   *Expect:* **not** offered — only reverted drafts come back, not every draft.

**C — Bidder identity (AUC-012)**

7. As dealer A, open a live auction where dealer B has already bid, and scroll the bid history.
   *Expect:* every row shows **initials only** (e.g. "JS") in both the avatar and the label.
   **Fail if any row shows a full name.**
8. Have dealer B place a bid while you watch.
   *Expect:* the new row also shows initials — the list is consistent top to bottom. Previously
   pre-loaded rows showed names and live rows showed initials.

**D — Payment deadline (AUC-022)**

9. Win an auction **while watching the live screen** (socket path).
   *Expect:* AuctionComplete opens with a countdown reading roughly **71:59:xx**, not 24:00:00.
10. Kill and reopen the app, then reach the same win from **My Bids**.
    *Expect:* a countdown still near 72h, counting from the auction's end. It may differ from
    step 9 by seconds-to-minutes — that is the known `wonAt` vs `endTime` approximation, not a
    bug. **Fail if either shows ~24h, or if the number resets to a full 24h on every reopen.**
11. Leave the screen open a minute.
    *Expect:* it ticks down once per second and does not reset.

**E — Reconnect resync (AUC-017)**

12. On a live auction with the connection banner visible, turn airplane mode on for ~30s, then
    off.
    *Expect:* the banner clears and the screen **refreshes to current state** — current bid,
    bid history and timer all correct — **without** the full-screen loader blanking the page.
13. Harder, but the case that matters: have the auction **end** while you are disconnected,
    then reconnect.
    *Expect:* the screen reflects the ended state. Previously it could sit on ACTIVE with a
    frozen 00:00:00 forever.
14. While reconnecting, confirm the socket does not tear down repeatedly (bids keep arriving
    live afterwards) — this is the regression the ref indirection exists to prevent.

**F — Regression sweep**

15. Force the auction load to fail (airplane mode, then open an auction) and tap **Retry**.
    *Expect:* it retries and shows the loader — the retry path is still the loud one.
16. Place a bid, cancel it within 24h, check anti-snipe extension still toasts.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here. All expectations are derived from code read in
  this session plus the backend contract.
- Steps 12-14 (socket reconnect) are the least verifiable from here — the ref indirection is
  reasoned from the existing comment about mid-auction teardown, not observed.
- `auction.gateway.ts` was not re-read this session; the "replays nothing on rejoin" claim
  rests on the Pass 4 citation (`:65-75`), not a fresh read.
- `AuctionResultsModal`'s mobile equivalent was not read; step A2's "already selected"
  expectation rests on `presetListingId` handling in `openCreateModal`, which I did read.

### Logged for the backend — not mobile parity work

- `GET /bids/my` should select `wonAt` on the auction (`bids.service.ts:203-211`) so the
  payment deadline can be computed exactly on the bids screen instead of approximated from
  `endTime`.

**Next session:** Flow 2b — `parity/auction-truthfulness` (AUC-016, AUC-038, AUC-025, OQ-9).

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 2b: Auction truthfulness (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/auction-truthfulness`, cut from `main` at `187b88a4` — the first flow cut under
**P-5**, with Flows 1 and 2a already merged in.

Rows: **AUC-016, AUC-038, AUC-025, BUY-028/OQ-9** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

Four places where the app stated something untrue or defaulted to a wrong number. Grouped
because they are one defect class in three adjacent files, not because they are related
features.

### Changes

**AUC-016 — a button that lied.** The seller panel's RESERVE button opened an "Adjust Reserve
Price" prompt and, on confirm, alerted "Reserve Updated — your reserve price has been
updated." It made no API call at all. **Removed** per P-4 (`AuctionDetailScreen.tsx:1661-1673`).
Wiring it was never an option where it sat: `PATCH /auctions/:id` throws for any auction that
is not `SCHEDULED` (`auctions.service.ts:434-436`, read this session), and that panel renders
only on a live auction. The reserve status bar above it is kept — it reads real state and web
has no equivalent. CLOSE NOW now occupies the action row alone.

**AUC-038 — a header that contradicted the list under it.** The paid state read "PURCHASE
COMPLETE / Handover confirmed" directly above a journey list showing "Handover to be booked"
and "Handover confirmed" as *incomplete*. Now reads **"PAYMENT COMPLETE / Buyer fee paid"**
(`AuctionCompleteScreen.tsx:341-342`) — what has actually happened at that point. The journey
list is untouched; the two now agree. Mobile still has no live handover status card (AUC-020,
Phase D) — this row only stops the screen contradicting itself.

**AUC-025 — a warning that arrived too late, i.e. never.** A seller could complete an auction,
photograph and upload handover proof, get approved, and only then find there was nowhere to
send the £100. `SellerAuctionsScreen` now reads `GET /users/stripe-connect/status` (`:302-311`,
the same call `SettingsScreen.tsx:266-274` already makes) and renders an amber tappable warning
inside the handover block, above the upload button, routing to Settings (`:1013-1026`).

Three states, deliberately, not two: `null` renders **nothing** — a failed status call must not
accuse a seller of missing setup they actually have; `false` warns; `true` is silent. Also
suppressed once `sellerBonusReleased`, since by then the money has demonstrably gone somewhere.

**BUY-028 / OQ-9 — a default that was one forgetful caller from undercharging.** `buyerFee` is
now **required** on `PurchaseFlowParams` (`PurchaseFlowScreen.tsx:45`); the £95 destructuring
default is gone (`:94`). The bare-navigation fallback object uses **0** rather than a
plausible-looking fee (`:88`) — that path has no `listingId` and cannot pay anyway, and a
visible £0 fails obviously where £95 would fail quietly.

The type change produced **no new tsc errors**, which confirms every caller already passes a
fee; grepped to confirm all five pass **125** (`BuyerBidsScreen:383`, `ChatScreen:454`,
`AuctionDetailScreen:451,1033,1617`). So nothing was being mispriced — this closes the hole
rather than fixing an active bug.

Four files: `screens/vehicle/AuctionDetailScreen.tsx`, `screens/main/AuctionCompleteScreen.tsx`,
`screens/seller/SellerAuctionsScreen.tsx`, `screens/main/PurchaseFlowScreen.tsx`. No backend
change, no new dependency. Two new style entries, both tokenised (`Colors.warningAlpha10/30`).

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit
exit=2 — 22 errors, all in src/components/__tests__/VehicleCard.test.tsx (@types/jest)
Errors outside that file: 0.  Identical to the Flow 0 baseline.

$ npx eslint <the four changed files>
exit=0 — 1 warning, the pre-existing unused eslint-disable in SellerAuctionsScreen
(baseline line 650, now 712). No new problems.

$ npm run lint
exit=1 — 25 problems (12 errors, 13 warnings). Identical to the Flow 0 baseline.
```

Note the merged tree was also gated before Flows 1 and 2a were merged to `main`: same
22 / 25, so the merge itself introduced nothing.

### Manual test script

Needs a seller account with an ENDED auction that has a winner, and — for step 6 — an account
whose Stripe Connect onboarding is **not** complete.

**A — Reserve button removed (AUC-016)**

1. As the seller, open your own **live** auction and scroll to the seller panel.
   *Expect:* the reserve status bar is still there and correct — green "Reserve met — current
   bid £X" once bidding passes the reserve, amber "Reserve not yet met — need £X" before.
2. *Expect:* **no RESERVE button.** CLOSE NOW is the only action button and spans the row.
   **Fail if any control claims to change the reserve.**
3. Tap CLOSE NOW and cancel the confirmation.
   *Expect:* unchanged behaviour — this flow did not touch it.

**B — Completion header (AUC-038)**

4. As a buyer who has won an auction, pay the £125 fee and reach the completed state.
   *Expect:* header reads **"PAYMENT COMPLETE / Buyer fee paid"**. **Fail if it says "Handover
   confirmed"** while the list below shows handover steps outstanding.
5. Check the YOUR JOURNEY list directly beneath.
   *Expect:* "Auction ended" and "Buyer fee paid" ticked; both handover rows still open. Header
   and list agree.

**C — Payout warning (AUC-025)**

6. As a seller **without** completed Stripe Connect onboarding, open My Auctions and find an
   ENDED auction with a winner.
   *Expect:* an amber warning above "Upload Handover Proof" reading "Payout method not set
   up…". Tapping it opens Settings.
7. Complete Stripe Connect onboarding, return, pull to refresh.
   *Expect:* the warning is gone.
8. **The state that matters most:** put the device in airplane mode and open the screen so the
   status call fails.
   *Expect:* **no warning at all.** A seller who *has* set up payouts must never be told they
   have not because a request failed.
9. An auction where the £100 has already been released.
   *Expect:* no warning, and the existing "£100 payout released" pill unchanged.

**D — Buyer fee (OQ-9)**

10. Reach the purchase/payment screen from all the routes that lead there: My Bids, the live
    auction banner, the auction detail buy-fee button, and a chat "pay" action.
    *Expect:* **£125** on every one. **Fail on any £95.**
11. Check the order summary total on each.
    *Expect:* £125 for a commission payment, with no sale price stacked on top.

**E — Regression sweep**

12. Upload handover proof on an ENDED auction. *Expect:* unchanged — uploads, then "Awaiting
    admin approval".
13. Open the auction list tabs (ALL / LIVE / SCHEDULED / ENDED / WON). *Expect:* unchanged.
14. Re-run Flow 2a's step A2 (re-auction picker) to confirm this flow did not disturb it — both
    flows edit `SellerAuctionsScreen`.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- Step C8 (status call failing) is reasoned from the `null` branch, not observed.
- The exact `GET /users/stripe-connect/status` response shape was confirmed only as far as
  `onboardingComplete` (`users.service.ts:482,514`); the rest of the payload was not read.
- The visual result of CLOSE NOW spanning the action row alone was not rendered — it is a
  `flex: 1` button in a two-child row that now has one child, so it should fill, but that is
  reasoning rather than a screenshot.
- Step D10's chat route (`ChatScreen:454`) was grepped for its `buyerFee` value, not traced
  through to the screen.

**Next session:** Flow 3 — `parity/search-and-offer-contract`
(BUY-022, BUY-006, BUY-017, BUY-007, BUY-008).

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 3: Search and offer contract (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/search-and-offer-contract`, cut from `main` at `187b88a4`.
Rows: **BUY-022, BUY-006, BUY-017, BUY-007, BUY-008** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

**This flow contains the first backend change of Phase 2, explicitly approved before it was
made.** Flow 2b is still unmerged on its own branch; it touches no file this flow touches.

### Two findings that changed the work

**BUY-017 was mis-framed, and the fix was not available client-side.** The row implies mobile
diverges from web. It does not: web links *every* search result to `/buy-cars/${listing.slug}`
regardless of listing type (`src/app/search/page.tsx:1191,1231`) — the row's web citation
(`:969-983`) is the listing-type *filter*, not the routing. So web has the same gap.

More importantly mobile *could not* have fixed it alone: `GET /listings` included only the
`seller` relation (`listings.service.ts:503-517`), so a search result carried the `type` scalar
but nothing identifying which auction, and no endpoint resolves an auction by listing id
(`auctions.controller.ts` exposes `GET /auctions/:id` only). The existing linked-auction banner
on the retail screen does not cover this — that is for retail↔auction *pairs*, not
auction-typed listings. Raised as a blocker; the repo owner approved the backend change.

**BUY-007 needed no new data at all.** `src/data/carData.ts` already ships `CAR_MAKES`, 71
entries, which I diffed against web's `src/lib/carData.ts` — byte-identical, nothing missing in
either direction. `SearchScreen` simply never imported it and hardcoded ten makes instead.

### Changes

**Backend (approved) — `backend/src/listings/listings.service.ts:518-525`.** `findAll` now
includes `auction: { select: { id, status, endTime } }`. Scalars only, no bids, so it is one
join and no N+1. Web receives the same field and could make the same routing fix.

**BUY-022 (P0, money-adjacent).** `OFFER_MIN` is now `Math.floor(listing.price * 0.7)`
(`VehicleDetailScreen.tsx:329`) instead of an absolute `price - 15000`, matching
`offers.service.ts:55-64` and web. The old window diverged in both directions: negative floor on
a £10k car (offers submitted, then rejected by the server with a generic alert), £85k floor on a
£100k car (blocking offers the backend would have accepted down to £70k). Prefill moved from
`price - 2500` to 90% of asking (`:193`), matching web — the flat figure could open the modal
already below the floor on a cheap car. The floor hint now names the number and the rule
(`:1890`). Mobile still sends only `amount`; the backend checks `amountMax ?? amount`, so the
check lands on the right value. BUY-023 stays open and out of scope.

**BUY-006.** `TRANSMISSIONS` constant separating enum values from labels
(`SearchScreen.tsx:139-144`): `SEMI_AUTO` → `SEMI_AUTOMATIC`, `CVT` added. Labels are explicit
rather than `t.replace('_',' ')`, which would have rendered "SEMI AUTOMATIC".

**BUY-008.** `CAT_C` and `CAT_D` added (`:119-131`) — all eight of web's values.

**BUY-007.** Type-to-filter field over `CAR_MAKES`, falling back to the ten popular makes when
empty (`:67`, `:193-199`, `:1502-1524`) — the native equivalent of web's input-plus-datalist.
A selected make outside the popular ten is unioned into the default list so an active filter
never disappears. Selection stays single-value: the backend has no `makes[]` param and
`buildParams` only ever sent `selectedMakes[0]`, which the existing comment already recorded.

**BUY-017.** Mapper carries `type` and `auction` through (`listingsApi.ts:308-309`,
`data/listings.ts`) — both were being dropped. `handleCardPress` routes an AUCTION result with a
known auction id to `LiveAuctionDetailed` (`SearchScreen.tsx:264-280`), falling through to
retail detail when the id is absent, since an auction-typed listing whose auction has not been
created yet is a real state and the retail screen renders it acceptably.
`MainStackParamList.LiveAuctionDetailed` now types `auctionId`, which
`AuctionDetailScreen.tsx:261` has always read — every caller previously reached it through an
`as any` cast.

Six files: `backend/src/listings/listings.service.ts`, `screens/main/SearchScreen.tsx`,
`screens/vehicle/VehicleDetailScreen.tsx`, `lib/listingsApi.ts`, `data/listings.ts`,
`navigation/MainStackNavigator.tsx`. No new dependency.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit            (mobile)
exit=2 — 22 errors, all in src/components/__tests__/VehicleCard.test.tsx (@types/jest)
Errors outside that file: 0.  Identical to the Flow 0 baseline.

$ npx tsc --noEmit            (backend — first time this flow series has touched it)
exit=2 — 3 errors: payments.controller.ts:62, sellers.service.ts:195,
tasks/db-backup.service.ts:45. Confirmed pre-existing by stashing this change and
re-running against HEAD: same 3. None in listings.service.ts.

$ npm run lint
exit=1 — 24 problems (11 errors, 13 warnings).
**One better than the Flow 0 baseline of 25/12** — see below.
```

**The lint baseline moved, deliberately.** `VehicleDetailScreen.tsx:3108` had a raw
`rgba(239,68,68,0.10)` where `Colors.errorAlpha10` exists. `CLAUDE.md` says to migrate token
call sites in files you touch, and this flow opens that file, so it is fixed. **New baseline for
Flow 4 onward: tsc 22 (mobile) / 3 (backend), lint 24 problems, 11 errors, 13 warnings.**

### Manual test script

**A — Offer floor (BUY-022, the P0)**

1. Open a vehicle priced around **£10,000** and tap Make an Offer.
   *Expect:* the field opens at **£9,000** (90%). The stated range floor is **£7,000**, not a
   negative number. Tapping "−" repeatedly stops at £7,000.
2. Try to submit at the floor. *Expect:* accepted by the server — no "Offer must be at least…"
   alert. Previously the app allowed below-70% offers and the server rejected them.
3. Open a vehicle priced around **£100,000**.
   *Expect:* prefill £90,000, floor **£70,000** — previously £85,000, which blocked legitimate
   offers. Step down to £70,000 and submit. *Expect:* accepted.
4. At the floor, check the hint text. *Expect:* "Minimum offer is £X — 70% of the asking price",
   naming the number.
5. Tap "+" past the asking price. *Expect:* still capped at asking, unchanged from before.

**B — Transmission and condition filters (BUY-006, BUY-008)**

6. Open Refine Search → TRANSMISSION. *Expect:* four chips — Automatic, Manual,
   **Semi-Automatic**, **CVT**. Labels read properly, not "SEMI AUTOMATIC".
7. Select Semi-Automatic, apply. *Expect:* results, or a clean empty state — **no error, no
   500**. Previously this sent an invalid enum value straight through to Prisma.
8. Select CVT, apply. *Expect:* CVT vehicles are now reachable.
9. CONDITION. *Expect:* eight chips including **Cat C** and **Cat D**. Filter on each.

**C — Make filter (BUY-007)**

10. Open Refine Search → MAKE. *Expect:* a search field above the chips, and the familiar ten
    popular makes below it.
11. Type "sko". *Expect:* **Skoda** appears. Select it, apply, confirm results are Skodas.
12. Reopen the filter. *Expect:* Skoda is still visible and still selected, even though it is
    not one of the popular ten — that is the union behaviour.
13. Type nonsense ("zzz"). *Expect:* "No makes match "zzz"", not an empty void.
14. Clear with the ✕. *Expect:* the popular ten return.
15. Select a second make. *Expect:* it replaces the first — single-select, as before.

**D — Auction routing (BUY-017) — needs the backend deployed**

16. **Deploy the backend first.** Without it, `auction` is absent from search results and every
    result opens retail detail — i.e. exactly the old behaviour, silently. Worth confirming that
    fallback is harmless before deploying.
17. Refine Search → Listing Type → **Auction**, apply, tap a result.
    *Expect:* the **live auction screen** with the bidding console, countdown and bid history —
    not the retail detail page.
18. Tap a CLASSIFIED result. *Expect:* retail detail, unchanged.
19. Tap an auction result from **Home** (the rails). *Expect:* unchanged — that path already
    worked and this flow did not touch it.

**E — Regression sweep**

20. Run a normal text search, scroll to trigger pagination. *Expect:* unchanged; the tap handler
    is still id-keyed via the ref, so cards should not re-render on scroll.
21. Apply several filters at once and Reset. *Expect:* everything clears including the make
    search field.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device, and **the backend change is not deployed** — step D17 will not pass
  until it is. Everything in D is untested against a live response.
- I did not run a request against `GET /listings` to confirm the new `auction` field serialises
  as expected; the change type-checks and the relation exists (`schema.prisma:697`), but the
  wire shape is inferred, not observed.
- `HorizontalVehicleCard.tsx` was not read this session. Pass 2 noted it was only read to L90
  of 286, so an internal navigation inside the card still cannot be fully excluded — if step
  D17 fails, that is the first place to look.
- Backend deployment, migrations and whether web needs redeploying to pick up the extra field
  were not investigated.
- Step A2/A3 expectations about server acceptance are read from `offers.service.ts`, not from a
  request I made.

### Logged for the web app — not mobile parity work

- Web now receives `auction` on `GET /listings` too, and could route auction search results to
  `/auctions/live/[id]` instead of `/buy-cars/[slug]`. Same defect, same one-line data source.

**Next session:** Flow 4 — `parity/session-and-auth` (AUTH-005, AUTH-013, AUTH-014, AUTH-034,
AUTH-035, AUTH-003). Largest flow in the plan; split into 4a/4b if it does not fit.

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 7: Dashboard error states (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/dashboard-error-states`, cut from `main` at `187b88a4`. Independent of the
stack above it (2b → 3, and 4a → 4b → 6) — it touches only dashboard screens, none of which
those flows opened, so it merges in any order.

Rows: **CROSS-023, DASH-047** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. One new row logged: **CROSS-025**.

One dedicated pass, per OQ-26, rather than folding this into each feature flow.

### The defect had three shapes, not one

The matrix describes `catch { /* show zeros */ }`. That is the *least* common form. Reading all
seven dashboards turned up three:

1. **The plain silent catch** — `UnifiedDashboardScreen:117`, `SellerPerformanceScreen:119`.
   `SellerPerformanceScreen`'s comment even claimed "EmptyState covers missing data", which is a
   different and wrong claim: an empty state says *you have no performance data*, not *we could
   not load it*.
2. **`Promise.allSettled` with unchecked results** — `SellerDashboardScreen`, `EarningsScreen`,
   `DealerEarningsScreen`. Here the `catch` almost never fires, because `allSettled` does not
   reject. A failed slice simply left its numbers at zero. This is the sneakiest of the three:
   the error handling *looks* present and does nothing.
3. **The bare `.catch(() => {})`** — `DealerAnalyticsScreen:244`. The worst instance in the app,
   and the exact scenario the audit called out: a dealer whose analytics call fails sees zero
   sales, zero leads and zero revenue, presented with total confidence.

### What changed

Seven screens, each now distinguishing **three** states rather than two — loading,
loaded-and-genuinely-zero, and failed — via the existing shared `ErrorBanner` with a working
retry. No new component; this is adoption, not invention.

- `UnifiedDashboardScreen` — fetch extracted to a `useCallback` so retry re-runs it.
- `SellerDashboardScreen` — counts rejected settlements and distinguishes **total** failure
  ("Could not load your dashboard") from **partial** ("Some of your dashboard could not be
  loaded"). Partial matters: the numbers on screen are real but incomplete, which is precisely
  what a silent zero hides.
- `EarningsScreen`, `DealerEarningsScreen` — handle the non-fulfilled branch of `allSettled`.
- `SellerPerformanceScreen` — replaces the misleading "EmptyState covers it" comment.
- `DealerAnalyticsScreen` — the bare catch now sets an error and clears stale analytics.
- `DealerProfileScreen` — keeps already-loaded data (right, and unchanged) but now *says* the
  refresh failed. Note `Promise.all` means one rejection loses both calls, so it fires more
  often than the single catch suggests.

**Genuinely empty data still renders as zeros with no banner.** That was the whole point of the
row, and it is the thing most likely to be got wrong by a careless version of this change.

**Screens reset to their empty value on failure** rather than leaving the previous render's
numbers sitting under an error banner — stale figures beneath a "could not load" message are
their own kind of lie.

### Scope boundary, and a new row

CROSS-023 and OQ-26 both scope this to *dashboards*. The same pattern survives on **list**
screens, where a failed fetch renders as an empty list: `PaymentHistoryScreen:120`,
`DealerMyOffersScreen:148`, `DealerTeamScreen:231`, `NotificationsScreen:86`,
`SellerAuctionsScreen:233,250`, `SellerListingsScreen:219`, `SellerOffersScreen:187`. Logged as
**CROSS-025** (P3) rather than silently expanding this flow. Lower severity — an empty list is a
weaker false claim than a confident zero-revenue figure — but the same lie.

`BuyerDashboardScreen:192` has it too. That screen is dead code today (CROSS-021), so it was
deliberately not edited here; **Flow 9 must fix it as part of reviving it**, and CROSS-025 says
so.

Seven files. No backend change, no new dependency, no new component.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit
exit=2 — 22 errors, all @types/jest in VehicleCard.test.tsx. Errors elsewhere: 0.

$ npm run lint
exit=1 — 25 problems (12 errors, 13 warnings) — this branch's base (cut from main,
so without Flow 3's token fix that makes it 24/11).
```

### Manual test script

The whole flow is about telling failure apart from emptiness, so it needs testing **both** ways
round. Airplane mode is the easiest way to force failure.

**A — Failure is visible (the fix)**

1. Sign in as a seller with real data. Open the dashboard and confirm the numbers are right.
2. Turn on airplane mode, pull to refresh.
   *Expect:* a red error banner with **Try again**, and the tiles **not** showing a confident
   set of zeros.
3. Turn airplane mode off, tap **Try again**.
   *Expect:* the banner disappears and the real numbers come back.
4. Repeat 2-3 on each of: Seller Performance, Earnings, Dealer home, Dealer Analytics, Dealer
   Earnings, and the main (Unified) dashboard.
   *Expect:* the same behaviour on all six. **Dealer Analytics is the important one** — that is
   where a dealer previously saw zero sales and zero revenue with no warning at all.

**B — Emptiness is still emptiness (the regression risk)**

5. Sign in as a **brand-new account with no listings, no sales, no offers**, on a good
   connection.
   *Expect:* zeros and empty states, and **no error banner anywhere**. If a new user sees "Could
   not load your dashboard", this change is wrong in the opposite direction.
6. Same account, Earnings.
   *Expect:* £0 with no banner — not an error.

**C — Partial failure (SellerDashboard specifically)**

7. Hard to stage deliberately; try it if you can. The seller dashboard fires three requests. If
   only some fail, *expect:* "Some of your dashboard could not be loaded" rather than the total
   failure message, with whatever loaded still shown.

**D — Regression sweep**

8. Pull-to-refresh on every screen above with a good connection. *Expect:* unchanged.
9. Dealer Analytics period pills (7d/30d/etc.) while online. *Expect:* still refetch correctly
   and no banner appears.
10. Confirm no banner ever appears on a normal, connected session — a banner that shows up
    spuriously is worse than the silent zeros it replaced.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- **Step B is the one I would most want run.** I have reasoned that empty data does not trigger
  the error path, but "new account sees a scary red banner" is exactly the failure mode a
  careless version of this change produces, and I cannot rule it out from reading alone.
- Step C (partial failure) is reasoned from the rejection count; I did not stage three requests
  with mixed outcomes.
- `DealerProfileScreen` uses `Promise.all`, so I could not easily distinguish partial from total
  failure there without restructuring the call — it reports a single "could not refresh"
  message. Left as is rather than reworking a screen this flow only needed to annotate.
- I did not audit whether every dashboard's *sub*-fetches (period toggles, secondary calls) are
  covered — only the primary load path of each screen was traced.

**Next session:** Flow 5 — `parity/account-deletion` (AUTH-033, DASH-030), the last ship-line
flow, moved here by decision P-2.

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 4a: Signup role picker and onboarding flag split (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/session-and-auth`, cut from `main` at `187b88a4`.
Rows: **AUTH-005, AUTH-001** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

**Flow 4 was split, as the plan pre-authorised.** 4a is the signup/onboarding half; 4b is the
session lifecycle half (AUTH-013, AUTH-014, AUTH-034, AUTH-035) and follows on its own branch
chained off this one, since both edit `authStore` heavily. The plan's instruction was to take
the split rather than half-land either half.

**A row ID in the plan was wrong.** The plan and the Phase 2 ordering both call the flag split
"AUTH-003". AUTH-003 is **Google OAuth sign-in**. The flag-pollution row is **AUTH-001**, whose
notes describe exactly this defect. Corrected in the matrix on AUTH-001; nothing renumbered.
Flow 4b's row list is unaffected.

### AUTH-005 — signup role picker

Mobile hardcoded `role = 'BUYER'`, so a dealer could not register as one at all: they had to
sign up as a buyer and then elevate. Now a two-card BUYER / DEALER picker
(`SignupScreen.tsx:49,151-186`), threaded through `signup(email, password, fullName, role)` to
`authStore.ts:303`.

**No backend change needed** — `syncUser` already validates `role` against the `UserRole` enum
and drops anything unrecognised (`users.service.ts:320`), read this session. BUYER + DEALER
only: FINANCE_PARTNER and the other partner roles are deliberately absent (OQ-5) because mobile
has no partner dashboard, and SELLER is not offered because buyer and seller are one account
here.

Choosing DEALER sets the **account role only**. It does not confer verification —
`dealerProfile.isVerified` still comes from KYC and `withDealerGate` still blocks dealer
screens — so the DealerOnboarding → KYC road is unchanged, just reachable without registering
as a buyer first.

**`CLAUDE.md:129-140` was updated in the same commit, and this matters.** That file actively
defended the BUYER hardcode; a later session reading it would have reverted this change. The
bug it guarded against was reading `get().role` — the local "preview as dealer" toggle — which
silently wrote DEALER into the database for people who never asked. An explicit choice on the
form is the opposite of that. The prohibition on `get().role` stands and is restated in code.

### AUTH-001 / OQ-3 — onboarding flag split

The pre-auth marketing carousel called `completeOnboarding()`, writing the same
`czm_onboarding_complete` key that gates the post-signup wizard. So a signed-out user tapping
through three marketing slides marked the wizard complete, and after signing up was never asked
for name, postcode or preferences.

- Carousel now writes its own `czm_intro_seen` via a new `completeIntro()`
  (`authStore.ts:16,111-114`, `OnboardingScreen.tsx:132-135`).
- `czm_onboarding_complete` is left to the wizard alone and its key is **deliberately
  unchanged**, so installs that already have it are not re-prompted — OQ-3's "default safely".
  The new key's absence on an existing install means "not seen", whose worst case is one extra
  viewing of the carousel, never a skipped wizard.
- **The carousel is now skipped once seen** (`AuthNavigator.tsx:40`) — owner-approved during
  the session. It was previously the initial route on *every* signed-out launch, so without
  this the new flag would have been written and never read. `hasSeenIntro` is hydrated
  unconditionally at the top of `initializeAuth` (`authStore.ts:126`), including on the
  no-session branch, which is precisely the branch that matters when signed out.

Five files: `screens/auth/SignupScreen.tsx`, `store/authStore.ts`,
`screens/onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx`, `navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx`, `CLAUDE.md`.
No backend change, no new dependency.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit
exit=2 — 22 errors, all @types/jest in VehicleCard.test.tsx. Errors elsewhere: 0.

$ npx eslint <the four changed source files>
exit=0 — clean, no warnings.

$ npm run lint
exit=1 — 25 problems (12 errors, 13 warnings).
```

**On the lint number:** this is 25/12, not the 24/11 Flow 3 established. That is correct and
not a regression — this branch is cut from `main`, which does not yet contain Flow 3's token
fix in `VehicleDetailScreen`. The baseline is per-base until the flows are merged. When Flow 3
lands on `main`, this branch's number becomes 24/11 too.

### Manual test script

**A — Dealer signup (AUTH-005)**

1. Sign out, go to Sign Up. *Expect:* an "I AM A" row above Full Name with two cards —
   **Buyer / Seller** (selected by default) and **Dealer**.
2. Tap Dealer. *Expect:* the card highlights and a note appears: "You'll complete dealer
   verification after signing up."
3. Complete signup as **Dealer**, verify the email, finish the wizard.
4. Open a dealer screen from the drawer (e.g. Dealer Inventory).
   *Expect:* the **dealer gate**, offering KYC — *not* the inventory itself, and *not* a
   buyer-only UI with the dealer entries missing. Choosing DEALER must not fake verification.
5. Complete DealerOnboarding → KYC. *Expect:* dealer screens unlock as before.
6. Sign up a second account as **Buyer / Seller**. *Expect:* buyer experience exactly as
   before this change.
7. **The regression that matters:** confirm neither account was created with the *other* role.
   Check the role on each profile after signup.

**B — Onboarding flag split (AUTH-001)**

8. **On a fresh install** (or after clearing app data): launch signed out.
   *Expect:* the marketing carousel.
9. Tap through or Skip to the end. *Expect:* Login.
10. Force-quit and relaunch, still signed out.
    *Expect:* **Login directly — no carousel.** It should not reappear.
11. Now sign up a brand-new account from that same install.
    *Expect:* the post-signup wizard **does** run — name, verify, postcode, preferences.
    **This is the bug being fixed: before, step 9 silently satisfied this gate and the wizard
    was skipped entirely.**
12. **Existing-install check, important:** on a device that had the app *before* this build and
    had already completed the wizard, update and sign in.
    *Expect:* **not** re-prompted for the wizard. The wizard's key is unchanged precisely so
    this holds.
13. Complete the wizard, sign out, sign back in. *Expect:* no wizard, no carousel.

**C — Regression sweep**

14. Sign out and back in on an existing account. *Expect:* unchanged.
15. Forgot-password flow. *Expect:* unchanged — it routes through the same Auth stack whose
    initial route changed.
16. Sign up with an email that already exists. *Expect:* the existing error handling.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- **Step A4 is the one I would most want tested.** That a DEALER-role account still hits the
  dealer gate is reasoned from `DealerGate` reading `isVerified || isDealerStaff`, neither of
  which signup sets — but I did not re-read `DealerGate.tsx` this session.
- Step B12 (existing install not re-prompted) cannot be exercised here at all; it depends on
  SecureStore state from a previous build.
- I did not read `PostSignupOnboardingScreen` this session beyond confirming it calls
  `completeOnboarding()`; its internal step order is untouched by this flow.
- Whether Supabase stores the chosen role in `user_metadata` usefully for anything downstream
  was not traced — it is passed, as before, but nothing was verified to read it.

**Next session:** Flow 4b — `parity/session-lifecycle` (AUTH-013, AUTH-014, AUTH-034,
AUTH-035), chained off this branch.

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 4b: Session lifecycle (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/session-lifecycle`, chained off `parity/session-and-auth` (Flow 4a) because both
rewrite `authStore`.

Rows: **AUTH-013, AUTH-014, AUTH-034, AUTH-035** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

This is the layer every screen sits on. A mistake here signs everyone out, so each change is
deliberately conservative and guarded.

### An open question from Pass 1, now closed

AUTH-014 was scoped to "no handler in `App.tsx`, `RootNavigator.tsx`, or `authStore.ts`" because
`ChatContext` had never been read. It has now: `ChatContext.tsx:135-136` **swallows**
`AUTH_REDIRECT` as an expected condition alongside `NO_SESSION` and `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`. So the
row holds in its strong form — nothing in the app acted on an expired session.

### AUTH-014 / OQ-6 — 401 now signs the user out

`apiClient` emits before throwing (`apiClient.ts:102`); `authStore` registers `forceLogout` as
the handler (`:571-573`).

They are connected through a new `lib/authEvents.ts` rather than a direct import. `authStore`
imports `apiClient`, so importing back would be a require cycle — Metro resolves those by
handing one module a half-initialised copy of the other, which for an auth store is a bug that
shows up once in a hundred cold starts. The new module imports nothing.

**The emit is latched.** A screen firing five requests on focus gets five 401s; without a latch
each runs its own teardown and its own navigation. First wins, rest are ignored. Re-armed on
`SIGNED_IN`, `TOKEN_REFRESHED` and a successful `login()`, so a later expiry in the same app run
is still acted on.

`forceLogout` deliberately does **not** call `POST /auth/logout` — the session it would
authenticate with is the one that just failed. It does call Supabase `signOut()`, so the dead
refresh token is cleared from SecureStore instead of being retried on next launch. It returns
early when already signed out, so it cannot yank a user who is legitimately sitting on Login.

### AUTH-034 — the destination survives re-login

`forceLogout()` reads the current route from `navigationRef` **before** the stacks swap
(`authStore.ts:146-160`), skipping auth screens as destinations.
`RootNavigator.tsx:32-52` consumes it exactly once after re-login, deferred one tick — the same
reason `App.tsx`'s deep-link handler defers, since navigating in the same tick targets the
navigator being unmounted. A route that no longer exists is caught and ignored: the user is
signed in, and Main's default route beats a blank screen. A deliberate `logout()` clears the
destination — that is not an interrupted journey.

### AUTH-035 — no more Login flash

**`isLoading` could not have been the fix**, which is worth recording since the row points at
it. It starts `false`, so there is a window between mount and `initializeAuth` running where it
and `isAuthenticated` are both false and the app looks signed out. Added `authInitialized`, set
in `initializeAuth`'s `finally` on success *and* failure (`:311`) — the question it answers is
"have we looked?", not "did we find one?" — and `App.tsx:253` holds the splash on
`!fontsLoaded || !authInitialized`.

### AUTH-013 — one app-wide subscription

`subscribeToAuthChanges()` (`authStore.ts:189-247`), mounted once in `App.tsx:197`.

- `SIGNED_OUT` → `forceLogout()`, guarded on `isAuthenticated` so our own logout does not
  trigger a second teardown racing the first.
- `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` → deliberately nothing. Recovery tokens 401 against the backend bridge,
  which is exactly why web skips it (`AuthContext.tsx:124-129`); routing to the reset screen is
  already handled by `App.tsx`'s deep-link branch.
- `SIGNED_IN` → **stands aside when `pendingEmailVerification` is true.**
  `VerifyEmailScreen.tsx:38-48` keeps its own handler to drive its spinner; without this guard
  the two would race on the same profile fetch. Otherwise rehydrates if not already signed in.
- `TOKEN_REFRESHED` → rehydrates only when local state thinks it is signed out (a cold restore
  that lost the race). The backend session outlives a token refresh, so the normal case needs
  nothing.

Five files: `lib/authEvents.ts` (new), `lib/apiClient.ts`, `store/authStore.ts`,
`navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`, `App.tsx`. No backend change, no new dependency.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit
exit=2 — 22 errors, all @types/jest in VehicleCard.test.tsx. Errors elsewhere: 0.

$ npx eslint <the changed source files>
exit=0. (App.tsx reports "File ignored because no matching configuration" — it sits
outside the eslint config's src glob, which is pre-existing and not introduced here.)

$ npm run lint
exit=1 — 25 problems (12 errors, 13 warnings). Same as Flow 4a: this branch chains off
4a, which is cut from main, so Flow 3's token fix (24/11) is not in this base.
```

### Manual test script

The theme of this flow is that failure states must not strand or spuriously eject the user, so
most of these steps are about what should *not* happen.

**A — Cold start (AUTH-035)**

1. Sign in, force-quit, relaunch.
   *Expect:* splash, then straight into the app. **No flash of the Login screen.** Watch
   carefully — the old bug was a single frame.
2. Relaunch in airplane mode while signed in.
   *Expect:* still no Login flash. The splash may hold slightly longer (the profile fetch times
   out at 10s), then the app opens. **It must not sign you out** — `authInitialized` is set on
   failure too, precisely so a failed check does not hang on the splash forever.
3. Relaunch while signed out. *Expect:* Login (or the carousel on a first run — Flow 4a).

**B — Session expiry (AUTH-014, AUTH-034) — the core of this flow**

4. Sign in and navigate somewhere specific and deep, e.g. a vehicle detail screen.
5. Invalidate the session server-side (sign the account out from web, or clear its Supabase
   session), then trigger a request on mobile — pull to refresh, or open a screen that fetches.
   *Expect:* you are returned to **Login**, once, cleanly. Previously nothing happened at all:
   the screen just stopped working.
6. Sign back in.
   *Expect:* you land back on **the screen from step 4**, not the app root.
7. Repeat step 5 on a screen that fires several requests at once (a dashboard).
   *Expect:* **one** trip to Login, not several — and no flicker of repeated navigation. This is
   what the latch exists for.
8. After a successful re-login, expire the session again.
   *Expect:* it still ejects you. The latch must have re-armed.

**C — Sign-out paths (AUTH-013)**

9. Sign out from the app normally. *Expect:* Login, unchanged from before.
10. Sign back in and go somewhere deep, then sign out normally.
    *Expect:* signing in again lands you at the **default screen, not** where you were. A
    deliberate sign-out is not an interrupted journey.
11. **Remote sign-out:** signed in on the device, sign that account out from the web app.
    *Expect:* the device notices and returns to Login. Previously unobserved entirely.
12. Leave the app backgrounded past a token refresh (an hour or so), then return.
    *Expect:* it still works and does **not** sign you out.

**D — Sitting on Login (the guard)**

13. Sign out, sit on the Login screen, and let any background request fail.
    *Expect:* nothing happens — no navigation, no flicker. `forceLogout` returns early when
    already signed out.

**E — Email verification, unchanged (the SIGNED_IN guard)**

14. Sign up a new account and stop on the Verify Email screen.
15. Click the verification link.
    *Expect:* the screen shows its spinner and proceeds into the app **once** — not twice, and
    with no double profile fetch. This is what the `pendingEmailVerification` guard protects.

**F — Password recovery, unchanged**

16. Run forgot-password to completion via the emailed link.
    *Expect:* exactly as before — the reset screen opens and the reset succeeds. The new
    `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` branch deliberately does nothing, so any change here is a regression.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here. For a flow whose failure mode is "everyone gets
  signed out", **that gap matters more than in any previous flow** — B, C and E are all timing
  and race behaviour that I have reasoned about but not observed.
- Step B7 (the latch under concurrent 401s) is reasoned from the latch logic, not observed.
- Step E15 (no double `initializeAuth`) rests on reading `VerifyEmailScreen`'s handler and the
  new guard; I did not instrument the calls.
- Step C12 (token refresh across a long background) cannot be simulated here at all.
- The 300ms defer in `RootNavigator` matches the existing deep-link handler's timing. It is a
  heuristic, not a guarantee — if step B6 lands on the app root instead of the intended screen,
  that constant is the first thing to look at.
- `GlobalToastProvider` and `ChatContext` both open sockets on auth state; I did not re-read how
  they react to `forceLogout` clearing the user mid-session.

**Next session:** Flow 6 — `parity/deep-linking-and-offline` (AUTH-020, AUTH-019, AUTH-030 +
CROSS-015, CROSS-017), the prebuild boundary. Flow 5 (account deletion) was moved after Flow 7
by decision P-2.

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 6: Deep linking and offline (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/deep-linking-and-offline`, chained off `parity/session-lifecycle` (4b) — both
edit `App.tsx` and `apiClient`.

Rows: **AUTH-020, AUTH-019, AUTH-030, CROSS-015, CROSS-017** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

**This is the prebuild boundary.** `app.json` changed and a native dependency was added, so
none of this reaches a binary without `npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android` followed by
a fresh build. `android/` is gitignored, so pulling this branch is not enough. Two commits,
kept separately reviewable as planned: linking first, offline second.

### AUTH-020 — a real linking config

`NavigationContainer` had no `linking` prop at all, so React Navigation never routed an inbound
URL and every deep link fell to one ad-hoc `expo-linking` listener that understood Supabase
tokens and nothing else. New `src/navigation/linking.ts` holds the route map; its `filter`
excludes auth-callback URLs so the config and the listener never both act on one link.

**Two deliberate limits, both recorded rather than half-built:**

1. **`VehicleDetail` and `LiveAuctionDetailed` are not linkable.** Both take a hydrated
   `listing: CarListing` route param. A URL can only carry a slug or id, so mapping them would
   hand the screen `{ slug }` where it reads `route.params.listing` — a crash on every inbound
   vehicle link. Making them linkable means first giving them an id-only entry path that
   self-fetches, which is a real change to two large screens and not this flow's job.
2. **iOS App Links are not configured.** `app.json` gains the Android https intent filter for
   `/auth/accept-invite`, but iOS needs `associatedDomains` *and* an
   `apple-app-site-association` file served from `carmazium.com` — server-side work outside this
   repo. So `https://` links open the app on **Android only**. The `carmazium://` scheme works
   on both, as before.

### AUTH-019 — the callback handler now covers web's branches

Mobile handled two of seven: implicit tokens, and a bare PKCE exchange. No error branch, no
rescue when the code had already been consumed, no timeout — so a failed or expired link left
the user on the splash with no feedback, indistinguishable from a working link that did nothing.

Now, in web's order: error param first; implicit tokens with recovery routing; PKCE with **both**
rescues — the exchange-error path and the AbortError path each fall back to `getSession()`,
because a session existing means success even when the exchange itself threw; and a 15s safety
alert in place of web's 15s forced redirect, since mobile has nowhere to redirect to.

**Those rescues matter more now than when the row was written.** Flow 4b added a global
`onAuthStateChange` subscription (AUTH-013) — precisely the kind of listener that races the
handler to consume the code, which is the same race web's own comments describe against its
`AuthContext`. Adding AUTH-013 without these rescues would have made this worse, not better.

### AUTH-030 — the invite link opens the app

`AcceptInvite` takes `{ token?: string }`, the linking config maps `/auth/accept-invite` to it,
and the screen auto-accepts when the token arrives by link — matching web, which accepts
straight from its `?token=` param with no extra tap.

**The paste field stays.** With iOS App Links unconfigured, pasting is still the only route on
iOS, so removing it would have broken the flow on one platform to tidy the other.

### CROSS-015 / CROSS-017 — offline, minimum viable

`@react-native-community/netinfo` 11.4.1, `src/lib/network.ts`, an `OfflineBanner` mounted once
above the navigator, and an `OFFLINE` sentinel in `apiClient` joining `NO_SESSION` /
`REQUEST_TIMEOUT` / `AUTH_REDIRECT`. **Scope is OQ-28's minimum: no request queueing, no cached
reads.** Both change what "saved" and "up to date" mean app-wide and were held for a separate
discussion.

Three judgement calls:

- **The monitor starts optimistic.** NetInfo's first callback is asynchronous; treating "not yet
  known" as offline would break cold start on a perfectly good connection.
- **The sentinel is raised after `fetch` fails, not pre-flight.** A stale or wrong reachability
  flag must never block a request that would have succeeded. Only once the request has genuinely
  failed is "you're offline" worth saying.
- **Only a definite `false` counts as offline.** `isInternetReachable` false-positives on
  captive portals and some Android emulators, and a wrong "you're offline" on a working
  connection is worse than one honest request failure.

`ChatContext.tsx:136` was extended to swallow `OFFLINE` alongside the other sentinels — the
banner already says it, and a chat error stacked on top is noise.

Nine files across two commits. `App.tsx`, `apiClient.ts`, `ChatContext.tsx`,
`MainStackNavigator.tsx`, `AcceptInviteScreen.tsx`, `app.json`, `package.json`, plus new
`navigation/linking.ts`, `lib/network.ts`, `components/OfflineBanner.tsx`.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit
exit=2 — 22 errors, all @types/jest in VehicleCard.test.tsx. Errors elsewhere: 0.

$ npx eslint <the changed source files>
exit=0 — clean.

$ npm run lint
exit=1 — 25 problems (12 errors, 13 warnings). Same as this branch's base.
```

One self-correction worth noting: the first pass added an `eslint-disable-next-line
react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` to the invite screen that the rule did not need. That would have
made the baseline 26/12 by adding a fourteenth unused-directive warning — the exact class of
lint debt already sitting in this repo. Removed before commit; the comment explaining the empty
dependency array stayed.

### Manual test script

**Prerequisite: `npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android`, then a fresh build.** Nothing in
section A or C will work on an existing binary — `app.json` and a native module both changed.

**A — Deep links (AUTH-020, AUTH-030)**

1. With the app **closed**, open `carmazium://notifications` (adb: `adb shell am start -W -a
   android.intent.action.VIEW -d "carmazium://notifications"`).
   *Expect:* the app cold-starts on Notifications, not the home screen.
2. Same link with the app **backgrounded**. *Expect:* it foregrounds onto Notifications.
3. `carmazium://settings`, `carmazium://messages`, `carmazium://dashboard/listings`.
   *Expect:* each lands correctly.
4. A **signed-out** device, then `carmazium://settings`.
   *Expect:* Login — not a crash, and not a screen that immediately errors. RootNavigator still
   decides Auth vs Main from session state; the URL does not override it.
5. `carmazium://this-route-does-not-exist`. *Expect:* the app opens normally, no crash.
6. **Android https link:** `https://carmazium.com/auth/accept-invite?token=<real token>`.
   *Expect:* the app opens on Accept Invite and **accepts automatically** — no pasting. First
   run may show the Android disambiguation dialog until App Links verification completes.
7. **iOS:** the same https link. *Expect:* it opens the **website**, not the app — that is the
   documented limitation, not a bug. The paste field must still work there.
8. Invite screen reached from the drawer with no token. *Expect:* the paste field, unchanged.

**B — Auth callback (AUTH-019)**

9. Sign-up verification email → tap the link. *Expect:* app opens, verification completes.
10. Forgot password → tap the emailed link. *Expect:* the reset screen, and the reset works.
    This path is the most likely regression in the whole flow.
11. Google sign-in, all the way through. *Expect:* returns to the app signed in.
12. **Tap an already-used verification link a second time.**
    *Expect:* a clear "Sign-in link problem" alert. **Previously: nothing at all** — the app
    just sat there, which is the actual bug in AUTH-019.
13. Let a recovery link expire, then tap it. *Expect:* an alert, not silence.

**C — Offline (CROSS-015)**

14. Turn on airplane mode with the app open.
    *Expect:* the amber "No internet connection" banner appears at the top within a second or
    two, over whatever screen you are on.
15. Pull to refresh a list while offline.
    *Expect:* a sensible failure, **not** a raw `TypeError: Network request failed`.
16. Turn airplane mode off. *Expect:* the banner disappears on its own.
17. Cold-start the app **with a working connection** and watch closely.
    *Expect:* **no flash of the offline banner.** This is what the optimistic default protects;
    a flash on every launch would mean the default is wrong.
18. Cold-start in airplane mode. *Expect:* banner shows; the app still opens (Flow 4b's
    `authInitialized` handles the failed session check).
19. Open Messages while offline. *Expect:* no chat error toast stacked on top of the banner.

**D — Regression sweep**

20. Normal navigation around the app with a good connection. *Expect:* the banner never appears
    and never occupies layout.
21. Re-run Flow 4b step B5 (session expiry ejects to Login) — `apiClient` changed again here, so
    confirm the 401 path still works.

### Not verified in this session

- **Nothing here has been prebuilt or run.** This is the flow where that gap is largest: the
  linking config, the intent filter and the native module are all things whose first honest test
  is a real build. Everything below is design intent, not observed behaviour.
- Whether Android App Links verification actually succeeds depends on an `assetlinks.json`
  served from `carmazium.com/.well-known/` — **I did not check whether one exists.** If it does
  not, step 6 will show the disambiguation dialog every time rather than opening the app
  directly. Worth checking before that step is called a failure.
- The `linking` config's `filter` is the only thing keeping React Navigation and the Supabase
  listener from both claiming a callback URL. I reasoned about the URL shapes; I did not observe
  a real Supabase link being filtered.
- NetInfo's behaviour on the specific test device is unknown — `isInternetReachable` semantics
  vary, which is why only a definite `false` is treated as offline.
- I did not audit every screen's error rendering for the new `OFFLINE` sentinel. Only
  `ChatContext` was updated; other screens will show their generic error path, which is a
  degradation from the banner's clarity but not a regression from the raw `TypeError` they
  showed before.

### Logged — not done in this flow

- **iOS App Links**: `associatedDomains` in `app.json` plus `apple-app-site-association` served
  from the domain.
- **Android `assetlinks.json`** if not already served.
- **Linkable vehicle/auction screens**: both need an id-only entry path that self-fetches before
  they can safely appear in the linking config.
- **Web has no offline handling either** — CROSS-015 was a shared absence and only mobile is
  addressed.

**Next session:** Flow 7 — `parity/dashboard-error-states` (CROSS-023, DASH-047), the last
ship-line flow before Flow 5.

---

## Phase 2 — Flow 5: Account deletion (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/account-deletion`, cut from `main` **after every prior flow was merged into it**
at the repo owner's direction — so this is the first flow built on the complete stack, and the
first whose lint baseline is the merged 24/11 rather than a per-branch number.

Rows: **AUTH-033, DASH-030** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

Moved to last by decision P-2: it is required before Play Store submission, not before the
side-loaded APK. It also depends on Flow 4b, whose `logout()` teardown it reuses.

### Contract details established by reading the endpoint, not assumed

Three things the matrix did not record, all of which shape the UI:

1. **The request must carry `{ confirmation: 'DELETE' }` in the body.** The controller 400s
   otherwise (`users.controller.ts:236-243`). So the typed field is a guard against a pointless
   round trip, not the only gate — the server enforces it independently.
2. **It is an anonymise, not a hard delete** (`users.service.ts:145-155`), and it **withdraws
   DRAFT / PENDING_REVIEW / ACTIVE listings** first (`:140-143`). The copy says exactly that
   rather than implying everything vanishes.
3. **The backend refuses deletion outright** while the user has a live auction as seller or an
   active bid as buyer (`:117-136`) — deliberately, so nobody dodges losing an auction by
   deleting. Those messages are specific and actionable, so the screen surfaces the server's own
   text rather than flattening it into "could not delete your account".

### What was built

A danger-zone section at the end of `SettingsScreen`, opening a typed-confirmation bottom sheet
that mirrors web's `DeleteAccountSection.tsx:73-97`. Confirm is disabled until the field reads
DELETE; the sheet cannot be dismissed mid-request.

Teardown **reuses the existing `logout()`** rather than writing a second path. It clears the
backend session, Supabase tokens and local state in the right order, `RootNavigator` swaps to
the Auth stack off the back of it, and its best-effort `POST /auth/logout` already tolerates the
session the server has just destroyed. Notably **not** `forceLogout()` — that one captures a
`postLoginRedirect` for a later return, which is precisely wrong for an account that no longer
exists.

One file: `src/screens/main/SettingsScreen.tsx`. No backend change, no new dependency.

### Quality gates — run on the fully merged tree

```

### Manual test script

**Use a throwaway account.** Deletion is irreversible and the email is rewritten, so the address
cannot be reused as-is.

**A — The guard**

1. Settings → scroll to the bottom. *Expect:* a red DANGER ZONE card explaining that listings
   are withdrawn and personal details removed.
2. Tap DELETE ACCOUNT. *Expect:* a sheet with a confirmation field; the confirm button is
   **disabled and dimmed**.
3. Type `delete` (lowercase). *Expect:* enabled — the check is case-insensitive, matching the
   server's `.toUpperCase()`.
4. Type `DELETEX` or clear the field. *Expect:* disabled again.
5. Tap Cancel. *Expect:* the sheet closes, nothing happens, the account still works.

**B — The blocking rules (the interesting cases)**

6. On an account **currently selling a live auction**, attempt deletion.
   *Expect:* the specific message "You have a live auction in progress. Please wait for it to
   end before deleting your account." — **not** a generic failure. The account still works.
7. On an account **with an active bid on a live auction**, attempt deletion.
   *Expect:* the equivalent bid message, and the account still works.

**C — Deletion itself**

8. On a throwaway account with **one ACTIVE listing**, note the listing, then delete.
   *Expect:* the sheet closes and the app returns to Login — no crash, no half-signed-in state.
9. Try to sign in again with those credentials. *Expect:* failure.
10. From another account, look for that seller's listing.
    *Expect:* **withdrawn**, not still live. This is the step most likely to reveal a gap
    between what the copy promises and what the backend does.

**D — Regression sweep**

11. Sign out normally from another account. *Expect:* unchanged.
12. Everything else in Settings — profile save, password change, payouts, bank details, trader
    verification. *Expect:* unchanged; this flow only appended to the screen.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- **Steps B6/B7 are the ones I would most want run.** That the server's specific message reaches
  the sheet rests on `apiClient` surfacing the backend's `message` field through
  `normalizeErrorMessage`, which I did not re-read this session.
- Step C10 (listing actually withdrawn) is read from `users.service.ts:140-143`, not observed.
- Whether the Supabase auth user is also removed or merely orphaned was **not traced** — the
  backend anonymises its own `User` row, and I did not check for a corresponding Supabase admin
  deletion. If it is orphaned, step 9 may fail in a different way than expected (a session with
  no backend user rather than a rejected sign-in). Worth watching.
- The sheet's behaviour if the app is backgrounded mid-request was not considered.

**Phase 2 ship-line status:** all ship-line flows are now built and merged to `main`
(1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4a, 4b, 6, 7 merged; 5 on its branch pending merge). **None are VERIFIED** —
every row is `NEEDS_VERIFICATION` and only the repo owner sets otherwise. Flow 6 requires
`npx expo prebuild --clean` and Flow 3's auction routing requires the backend deployed.

---

## Phase 3 (Phase D) — Flow 8: Chat presence and contact support (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/chat-presence-support`, cut from `main` with the whole ship-line merged in.
Rows: **DASH-023, DASH-024** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

First flow below the ship-line. Both rows are pure consumption of things the backend already
does — no backend change, no new dependency.

### DASH-023 — presence

The gateway broadcasts `presence:update` on connect and disconnect, and sends a
`presence:snapshot` of who is already online when you connect. Web consumes both.
`ChatContext` listened for `message:new`, `user:typing`, `messages:read` and `error` — neither
presence event — so mobile could never show who was reachable.

`ChatContext` now handles both and exposes `onlineUserIds: Set<string>`; `MessagesScreen`
renders a green dot on the partner's avatar.

Three choices worth recording:

- **The snapshot is handled, not just the update.** Without it every partner reads as offline
  until their next connect/disconnect, which is exactly why the gateway sends it
  (`chat.gateway.ts:116-124`). Handling only `presence:update` would look correct in a quick
  two-device test and be wrong in practice.
- **The set is cleared when our own socket disconnects.** Holding the last known state would
  show stale green dots for the length of the outage — a confident claim about something we can
  no longer observe.
- **The row takes a boolean, not the Set.** `ThreadRow` is `React.memo`'d specifically so a
  `FlatList` only re-renders the row that changed; passing the Set would hand every row a new
  prop identity on every presence change and defeat that.

Absence of a dot means "offline or unknown" — it never claims someone is offline.

### DASH-024 — contact support

`POST /chat/support` finds-or-creates a room with the oldest ADMIN and joins both parties
server-side. Mobile had no route to it at all. Added `getOrCreateSupportRoom()` to `chatApi` and
a **Contact Support** row in `GlobalDrawer` above Sign Out — the drawer is mobile's equivalent
of web's sidebar, where this sits for every role.

Opens the support chat room rather than an email client, matching web and keeping the
conversation in the product. The endpoint is idempotent, and the handler additionally guards on
its own in-flight state, because this is a button people will double-tap.

Four files: `context/ChatContext.tsx`, `screens/main/MessagesScreen.tsx`, `lib/chatApi.ts`,
`components/GlobalDrawer.tsx`.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit    22 errors, all @types/jest. Errors elsewhere: 0.
$ npx eslint <the four changed files>   exit=0, clean.
$ npm run lint        24 problems (11 errors, 13 warnings) — the merged baseline.
```

### Manual test script

Presence needs **two accounts on two devices** (or one device plus the web app signed in as the
other party) — it cannot be tested single-handed.

**A — Presence (DASH-023)**

1. Devices A and B, each signed in as a different account, with an existing conversation between
   them. Open Messages on A while B is signed in with the app open.
   *Expect:* a green dot on B's avatar in the thread list.
2. Force-quit the app on B. Wait a few seconds.
   *Expect:* the dot on A disappears without A refreshing.
3. Reopen the app on B. *Expect:* the dot returns on A.
4. **The snapshot case:** with B already online, force-quit and reopen the app on **A**.
   *Expect:* the dot is there immediately on A's first load — not only after B next reconnects.
   This is the case that fails if only `presence:update` is handled.
5. Put A in airplane mode. *Expect:* all dots clear rather than freezing as they were.
6. A conversation with someone offline. *Expect:* no dot, and no "offline" label either.

**B — Contact support (DASH-024)**

7. Open the drawer. *Expect:* a Contact Support row above Sign Out, on every role — buyer,
   seller and dealer.
8. Tap it. *Expect:* the drawer closes and a chat opens with CarMazium support.
9. Send a message, then go back to Messages. *Expect:* the support conversation is in the list.
10. Tap Contact Support again. *Expect:* the same conversation, not a second one — the endpoint
    is find-or-create.
11. Double-tap it quickly. *Expect:* one navigation, no duplicate rooms, no error.
12. Tap it with no connection. *Expect:* "Could not open support" with a real message, and the
    drawer stays usable.

**C — Regression sweep**

13. Normal chat: send and receive a message, typing indicator, unread badge. *Expect:*
    unchanged.
14. Scroll a long thread list. *Expect:* no jank — the memoised row should not be re-rendering.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here, and presence is inherently a two-device test.
- **Step A4 (the snapshot) is the one I would most want run.** It is the difference between
  presence that looks right in a quick test and presence that is right, and I have only reasoned
  about the gateway's emit order.
- Whether an ADMIN user actually exists in the target environment was **not checked**.
  `findOrCreateSupportRoom` pairs the user with the oldest ADMIN — if there is none, step 8 may
  fail server-side. Worth confirming before treating a failure there as a client bug.
- `ChatScreen` was not read this session, so how the support room renders once opened — title,
  avatar, any admin-specific affordances — is unverified.
- Presence is surfaced on the thread list only. Web also shows it in the conversation header;
  that is a possible follow-up, not done here.

## Phase 3 (Phase D) — Flow 9: Buyer dashboard merge (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/buyer-dashboard-merge`, cut from `main`.
Rows: **DASH-004, DASH-005, BUY-021** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. **CROSS-025** partially closed.

### A correction to BUY-021 — the screen was not dead

BUY-021 and CROSS-021 both record `WatchlistScreen` as unreachable dead code, on the strength of
`grep -rn "navigate('Watchlist'" src/` returning zero. It had **two** live routes:

- the buyer/seller group's **Watchlist** entry (`GlobalDrawer.tsx:138-144`), and
- the dealer **Wishlist** entry (`:204-213`).

Both go through the drawer's variable `navigate('Main', { screen: item.stackScreen })` — the
exact indirection CROSS-021 itself warns that greps miss. DASH-034 caught the dealer entry; the
buyer/seller one went unrecorded, and OQ-29's "delete it, it's dead" was decided on that
incomplete picture. Deleting it blind would have broken **two** live menu items.

Raised with the repo owner before acting; they confirmed the deletion with both entries
repointed. This is the second time this session that the drawer's variable navigation has
hidden a live route — worth treating any future "unreachable screen" claim as unproven until
the drawer's `stackScreen` and `tabName` lists have both been checked by hand.

### What changed

**DASH-004 / DASH-005 — `BuyerDashboardScreen` revived onto the live path.** `ProfileTabScreen`
already branched dealer vs everyone-else, so this is one small change there: buyers get
`BuyerDashboardScreen`, sellers keep `UnifiedDashboardScreen`, dealers keep `DealerProfileScreen`.
The canonical buyer tile set is therefore the richer one — Active Offers, Watching, Live Bids,
Auctions Won, Total Spent — and the 7d/30d period toggle becomes reachable for the first time,
which is the buyer half of DASH-005.

**Trade-off, stated up front rather than discovered later:** a buyer-role user who also lists
will no longer see UnifiedDashboard's inventory and revenue tiles on the Profile tab. Every
seller screen remains reachable from the drawer, so this changes which tiles are shown, not what
can be reached. Owner chose this option with that risk named.

**BUY-021 — `WatchlistScreen` deleted.** Both drawer entries repointed to the **Saved** tab via
the drawer's existing `tabName` mechanism (already used elsewhere, so no new pattern). The
screen file, its stack route and its `MainStackParamList` entry are all removed. `SavedScreen`
is the live equivalent over the same store, with a grid/list toggle and status badges that
`WatchlistScreen` lacked.

**CROSS-025 — fixed in `BuyerDashboardScreen` in the same commit**, as that row required, so the
screen was never live with the defect. Its `/dashboard/buyer` call drives every KPI tile, and
under `allSettled` a rejection never reached the catch — a dead network rendered as a buyer with
no offers, no bids and nothing spent. Featured-listing and unread-count failures still pass
quietly, being decorative by comparison. The eight list screens in CROSS-025 remain outstanding.

Four files changed, one deleted: `navigation/TabNavigator.tsx`,
`navigation/MainStackNavigator.tsx`, `components/GlobalDrawer.tsx`,
`screens/buyer/BuyerDashboardScreen.tsx`, and `screens/main/WatchlistScreen.tsx` (deleted).

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit    22 errors, all @types/jest. Errors elsewhere: 0.
$ npx eslint <the four changed files>   exit=0, clean.
$ npm run lint        24 problems (11 errors, 13 warnings) — the merged baseline.
```

tsc passing is worth more than usual here: it is what proves the deleted screen had no
remaining referenced import, route or param-list entry.

### Manual test script

**A — Buyer dashboard (DASH-004, DASH-005)**

1. Sign in as a **buyer** and open the Profile tab.
   *Expect:* the richer dashboard — ACTIVE OFFERS, WATCHING, LIVE BIDS, AUCTIONS WON and a
   full-width TOTAL SPENT — not the old four-tile overview.
2. *Expect:* a **7D / 30D toggle**. Switch it.
   *Expect:* Total Spent re-queries and the sublabel changes between "last 7 days" and "last 30
   days".
3. Sign in as a **seller**. *Expect:* the Profile tab is **unchanged** — the old
   UnifiedDashboard with inventory and revenue tiles.
4. Sign in as a **dealer**. *Expect:* unchanged — DealerProfile.
5. As a buyer, check the drawer still lists My Listings, Earnings and the other seller entries.
   *Expect:* present and working. This is the mitigation for the trade-off above; if these are
   missing, the trade-off is worse than described.

**B — Watchlist deletion (BUY-021) — the regression risk**

6. As a **buyer/seller**, open the drawer and tap **Watchlist**.
   *Expect:* the **Saved tab** opens, showing saved cars with the grid/list toggle. **Fail if
   nothing happens or the app errors** — that would mean the route was deleted without the entry
   being repointed.
7. As a **dealer**, open the drawer and tap **Wishlist**.
   *Expect:* the same Saved tab. This is the second entry the audit did not record.
8. Save a car from a listing, then reach it by both routes above. *Expect:* it appears in both.
9. Tap the Saved **bottom tab** directly. *Expect:* unchanged from before.

**C — Error state (CROSS-025)**

10. As a buyer, turn on airplane mode and pull to refresh the Profile tab.
    *Expect:* a red error banner with **Try again**, and **not** a confident set of zeros.
11. Reconnect, tap Try again. *Expect:* real numbers return.
12. Sign in as a **brand-new buyer with no offers, bids or purchases**, on a good connection.
    *Expect:* zeros and empty states with **no error banner** — the same
    emptiness-is-not-failure check as Flow 7.

**D — Regression sweep**

13. Navigate the whole drawer, every entry, on each role. *Expect:* no dead taps — this flow
    removed a route that two entries pointed at.
14. Deep link `carmazium://` to any route. *Expect:* unaffected; `Watchlist` was never in the
    linking config.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- **Steps B6/B7 are the highest-risk in this flow.** Deleting a route that live menu items point
  at is exactly the failure this flow was at risk of, and `tabName` navigation for these two
  entries has not been exercised — only read.
- `BuyerDashboardScreen` was read only around its fetch, tiles and toggle. The rest of its 624
  lines — hot deal card, recent activity rows, any navigation out of it — was **not** reviewed,
  and it has never run in production, so it may carry defects the audit never had reason to
  find. It is the first time this screen will execute at all.
- I did not compare `BuyerDashboardScreen`'s navigation targets against the current
  `MainStackParamList`; a stale route name inside a screen that has never run would only surface
  at tap time.
- `SavedScreen` was not read this session; step B8's "appears in both" rests on both reading the
  same watchlist store, which BUY-021 records.

---

## Phase 3 (Phase D) — Flow 10: Profile completion prompt (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/profile-completion-prompt`, cut from `main`.
Row: **DASH-003** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`.

### A deliberate divergence from web, decided rather than drifted into

Web's `ProfileCompletionGate` is a **non-dismissible** modal covering the entire dashboard until
`firstName`, `lastName` and (for non-dealers) `phone` are set. Porting it faithfully would have
been the obvious reading of this row.

Mobile has already faced this exact class of problem and gone the other way, with the reasoning
written into the file: `LocationPromptSheet` handles missing location/postcode as a **dismissible
nudge** because "blocking an existing user out of the app over a field they were never asked for
would be a far worse outcome than a missing postcode".

That argument applies with more force to a phone number — an existing seller mid-sale should not
be locked out of their own dashboard over one. Raised with the repo owner, who chose the
dismissible prompt. **This is an intentional divergence, not an incomplete port**, and it is
recorded as such on DASH-003 so a later reader does not "finish the job" by hard-gating it.

### What was built

`ProfileCompletionPromptSheet`, mirroring `LocationPromptSheet` deliberately closely — same
bottom-sheet shape, same once-per-session module-scope dismissal (so it resets on relaunch
rather than retiring forever after one tap), same "not shown mid-onboarding" guard, same
direct-store-update-instead-of-refetch on save.

Differences from the location prompt, each for a reason:

- **Dealers are exempt from the phone requirement**, matching web
  (`ProfileCompletionGate.tsx:26`) — they supply a dealer phone separately through the dealer
  profile. Read from `accountRole`, not `role`, so a dealer previewing as a buyer is not suddenly
  asked for a personal phone number.
- **The fields shown are only the missing ones**, and the blurb changes accordingly — asking for
  a name that is already set would look broken.
- **It defers to `LocationPromptSheet` when both would fire.** Two bottom sheets rendering
  simultaneously stack badly. The location prompt is the older, already-shipping one, so it goes
  first and this waits for the next session rather than fighting it for the screen. Worth knowing
  when testing: an account missing *everything* will be asked about location this session and
  name/phone the next.

Two files: new `components/ProfileCompletionPromptSheet.tsx`, and `App.tsx` to mount it beside
the existing prompt. No backend change, no new dependency.

**Known trade-off:** users who keep dismissing stay incomplete, so phone coverage improves more
slowly than a hard gate would achieve. That is the cost of the option chosen, and it is the right
cost to pay here.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit    22 errors, all @types/jest. Errors elsewhere: 0.
$ npx eslint src/components/ProfileCompletionPromptSheet.tsx   exit=0, clean.
$ npm run lint        24 problems (11 errors, 13 warnings) — the merged baseline.
```

### Manual test script

Needs accounts in specific states, which is the awkward part — the prompt only appears for
accounts that are *missing* something. Easiest via direct profile edits, or an older account.

**A — The prompt appears when it should**

1. An account with **no phone number** (non-dealer), past onboarding, with location and postcode
   set. Sign in.
   *Expect:* a "Complete your profile" sheet asking for a phone number only — no name fields,
   since the name is already set.
2. Enter a number, tap SAVE.
   *Expect:* the sheet closes and the number is saved. Check Settings — the phone should be
   there.
3. Sign out and back in. *Expect:* **no prompt** — the field is now set.

**B — Dismissal behaves like the location prompt**

4. On another incomplete account, tap **Not now**.
   *Expect:* the sheet closes and does not return for the rest of the session, however much you
   navigate.
5. Force-quit and reopen, still signed in.
   *Expect:* it **asks again**. Once-per-session means per app run, not forever — if it never
   returns, the dismissal is being persisted, which is wrong.

**C — Exemptions and ordering**

6. A **dealer** account with no personal phone. *Expect:* **no prompt** for phone. Dealers are
   exempt.
7. An account missing **name and phone**. *Expect:* both sets of fields in one sheet, with a
   blurb mentioning both.
8. **The ordering case:** an account missing location/postcode **and** name/phone.
   *Expect:* the **location** prompt this session, and **only** that one — no second sheet
   stacked behind or on top of it. Complete it, force-quit, reopen: *expect* the profile prompt
   now.

**D — It stays out of the way**

9. A fully complete account. *Expect:* no prompt, ever.
10. A brand-new signup going through post-signup onboarding.
    *Expect:* no prompt during onboarding — that flow collects the name itself, and asking twice
    would look broken.
11. While the sheet is open, check the app underneath is still reachable by dismissing.
    *Expect:* yes — this is a nudge, not a gate. **If it cannot be dismissed, the wrong option
    got built.**

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- **Step C8 (the two-sheet ordering) is the one I would most want run.** The deferral is a
  boolean check I reasoned about, not something I have seen; if it is wrong, the symptom is two
  bottom sheets fighting for the screen, which would be obvious but ugly.
- `PATCH /users/me` accepting `firstName`/`lastName`/`phone` in one call is taken from
  `LocationPromptSheet`'s use of the same endpoint and web's gate doing the same; I did not
  re-read the DTO this session. Given the backend rejects unknown properties, a wrong field name
  here would fail loudly at step A2 rather than silently.
- Whether any screen reads `user.phone` and would benefit immediately was not surveyed.
- The prompt is mounted app-wide, like the location one, so it can appear over any screen. I did
  not check how it looks over a modal-heavy screen such as the sell wizard.

## Phase 3 (Phase D) — Flow 11: Auction bonuses in earnings (2026-09-01)

Branch `parity/earnings-auction-bonuses`, cut from `main`.
Row: **DASH-010** → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. **Phase D complete.**

### The data was already on the wire

The row reads as a missing feature, and I expected this flow to need a backend change. It did
not. `GET /listings/earnings` already returns `auctionSales`, `totalAuctionSales`,
`totalAuctionRevenue` and `totalAuctionBonus` (`listings.service.ts:1610-1663`). Mobile's
`EarningsResponse` type declared three fields and dropped the rest, so the data arrived on every
request and was discarded before any screen saw it.

### A correction to what the row implies

DASH-010 reads as though mobile sellers were missing auction money from their totals. They were
not: `totalRevenue` and `totalSales` **already include** the auction figures server-side
(`listings.service.ts:1651-1656`). The headline numbers on both mobile earnings screens have
always been right. What was missing was the **breakdown** — a seller could see a total that
included auction sales but had no way to tell which part came from auctions, and could not see
the £100 bonuses at all.

### What was built

An AUCTION BONUSES card on both `EarningsScreen` and `DealerEarningsScreen`, showing the total
bonus and the most recent five payouts with vehicle, date and winning bid.

Four judgement calls:

- **Shown as its own figure, not folded into revenue.** The £100 bonus is the only money
  CarMazium itself pays out — the winning bid is settled directly between buyer and seller, and
  the backend's own comment makes that distinction explicitly. Merging it into revenue would blur
  a line the backend deliberately keeps.
- **Only approved payouts appear.** The backend filters on `sellerBonusReleased: true`, set when
  an admin approves the handover proof, so this is money received rather than money expected. A
  seller mid-handover will not see a bonus they have not been paid.
- **Hidden entirely when there are none**, rather than rendering a £0 row. A seller who has never
  auctioned should not see an empty auction section on their earnings screen.
- **Capped at five rows** with a "+N more" line. This is a summary card on an earnings screen,
  not a ledger; `PaymentHistoryScreen` already exists for the full record.

Two files: `screens/seller/EarningsScreen.tsx`, `screens/main/DealerEarningsScreen.tsx`. No
backend change, no new dependency.

### Quality gates

```
$ npx tsc --noEmit    22 errors, all @types/jest. Errors elsewhere: 0.
$ npx eslint <both changed files>   exit=0, clean.
$ npm run lint        24 problems (11 errors, 13 warnings) — the merged baseline.
```

### Manual test script

Needs a seller or dealer account that has **won at least one auction as the seller and had the
handover approved** — an auction that merely ended is not enough, since the backend filters on
`sellerBonusReleased`.

**A — The card appears with real data**

1. As a seller with at least one approved auction handover, open Earnings.
   *Expect:* an AUCTION BONUSES card showing the total (£100 per approved auction) and a row per
   auction with the vehicle, the payout date and the winning bid.
2. Check the total against the row count. *Expect:* rows × £100 = the headline figure.
3. Cross-check TOTAL REVENUE against the seller's known sales.
   *Expect:* it **already included** the auction sales before this change — this flow did not
   alter it. If revenue jumped, something is double-counting.
4. Repeat on a **dealer** account via Dealer Earnings. *Expect:* the same card.

**B — The card stays away when it should**

5. A seller with **no auctions at all**. *Expect:* **no** auction card — not an empty one, not a
   £0 one.
6. A seller with an auction that **ended but whose handover is not yet approved**.
   *Expect:* still no card, or no row for that auction. Showing a bonus before the payout is
   released would promise money that has not been paid.
7. Airplane mode, pull to refresh. *Expect:* the error banner from Flow 7, and the auction card
   gone rather than showing stale figures.

**C — More than five**

8. An account with six or more approved auction bonuses (if one exists).
   *Expect:* five rows plus a "+N more" line, and the **total reflecting all of them**, not just
   the five shown.

**D — Regression sweep**

9. CSV export on both screens. *Expect:* unchanged — this flow did not touch it.
10. The Payment History link. *Expect:* unchanged.

### Not verified in this session

- Nothing run on a device; no Android SDK here.
- **Step A3 is the one worth checking carefully.** My reading is that `totalRevenue` already
  included auction revenue before this change, so the headline should not move. If it does move,
  my reading of `listings.service.ts:1651-1656` is wrong and the totals need re-examining.
- I did not confirm what `sellerBonusReleasedAt` looks like when a bonus is released but the
  timestamp is unset — the row falls back to `createdAt` and then to an em dash, but I have not
  seen a real record.
- The CSV export was not extended to include auction bonuses. Web's orphaned page has a separate
  Auction Sales tab; whether its export includes them was not traced. Possible follow-up.
- Neither earnings screen was read in full — only the fetch, the summary block and the styles.

## 2026-09-23 — One Product Block 5: Buyer journey

**Programme checkpoint:** Blocks 1–5 have now reached the buyer-business-rule checkpoint. The
remaining native TradeXchange service-job screens are not hidden inside this completion claim:
they remain the explicit Block 7 mobile surface gap.

### PR #189 — core buyer parity

- Mobile offer create/amend now preserves the optional seller message instead of dropping it.
- Native £125 auction-fee payments are reconciled against the exact Stripe PaymentIntent before
  CarMazium shows the fee as confirmed.
- Both native fee screens reuse the same submitted transaction while confirmation is pending, so
  a delayed webhook cannot invite a second £125 charge.
- The 72-hour winner payment deadline uses backend `wonAt` state and the won-auction contact
  actions use authoritative `buyerFeePaid`.
- Buyer-fee charging is winner-only.
- The existing £100 handover-denial refund supports both hosted Checkout (`cs_`) and native
  PaymentIntent (`pi_`) payments.
- Full repository CI passed and the merged main deployment completed successfully.

### PR #190 — verified inspection/refusal rule

The missing inspection/refusal rule is implemented against the real TradeXchange inspection job
rather than a buyer-entered claim:

1. A winner may create an INSPECTION job linked to that exact won auction.
2. The approved inspection provider must complete the job with a structured outcome:
   `PASS` or `FAULTS_FOUND`.
3. `FAULTS_FOUND` requires a written inspection summary.
4. Refusal is accepted only from the recorded winner, before approved handover, and only when a
   completed/released linked inspection recorded `FAULTS_FOUND`.
5. Stripe refunds the **full £125 buyer fee** first, using an idempotency key. If the refund
   fails, the vehicle sale is not unwound.
6. After a confirmed refund the auction sale is cancelled, the Sale record is removed, seller
   sales count is reversed, and the vehicle returns to seller control.
7. Standalone auction stock returns to CLASSIFIED/DRAFT. A linked retail listing returns to
   DRAFT rather than ACTIVE so a vehicle just recorded as faulted is not automatically
   advertised before repair/update.
8. Buyer and seller receive explicit notifications.

The web won-auction page can launch the linked inspection; the provider job page records the
outcome; the customer job page displays it and exposes the eligible full-refund refusal action.
Mobile now carries the same auction/refusal API contract, but mobile does not yet have the
TradeXchange customer/provider job screens. That UI remains under Block 7
(`service_provider.jobs` / Partner Account parity) and is recorded as a manifest gap.

### Drift prevention added

The parity guard now checks that the fault-verified inspection rule, full £125 refund and
`/refuse-after-inspection` contract remain present in backend, web and mobile API layers.
`product-parity.json` records `buyer.auction_inspection_refusal` as a gap until the Block 7
native service-job UI is delivered.



## 2026-09-23 — Block 6: Trader/dealer journey remediation complete

**Programme checkpoint:** Blocks 1–6 have now reached the business-rule parity checkpoint.

Completed in Block 6:

- Canonical dealership identity: active dealer staff act under `DealerProfile.userId` rather than creating personal shadow buyer/seller identities.
- Central RBAC contract: Owner, Admin, Sales Agent and Finance Manager permissions are resolved through `/dealers/access` and enforced server-side.
- Backend scope: bidding, auction winner/contact state, Buy It Now, inspection refusal, auction-linked delivery/inspection, inventory, CRM/offers, purchases, analytics, team/KYC and platform-fee payment.
- Web scope: dealer routes/navigation and read-only finance inventory consume live permissions; direct mutation routes are gated.
- Native scope: DealerGate, drawer/navigation and read-only finance inventory consume the same permission contract.
- Auction client closure: web and native live-auction, won-auction, bid-history and native Auction Complete surfaces use canonical dealership identity and gate `PLACE_BID`, `MANAGE_INVENTORY` and `PAY_AUCTION_FEE` controls consistently.
- Permanent parity coverage: `dealer.auction_staff_permissions` is a required manifest surface and `scripts/check-product-parity.mjs` guards against staff-ID winner checks or role-control drift.

**Explicit boundary:** full native Partner/TradeXchange provider job UI remains Block 7 and is not counted as a Block 6 gap.


## 2026-09-23 — Block 7: Native Partner/provider foundation

**Block 7 checkpoint:** Partner/provider foundation implemented; Block 7 remains in progress.

Completed in this slice:

- Native Partner Account dashboard under the same DEALER/Partner business identity as web.
- Partner business setup and account elevation reuse `/users/elevate` and `/users/dealer-profile`.
- Delivery & Recovery, Inspection, Finance and Warranty capability application/status under one Partner business.
- Stripe Connect onboarding entry for paid-job services and app-resume refresh.
- Native provider verification checklist with private PDF/image upload, 10 MB client guard, evidence metadata/history and pending-document deletion.
- Native matching settings for paid jobs and Finance/Warranty enquiries, including postcode/nationwide and service-specific filters.
- Partner Account is reachable from the native global drawer and Service Hub.
- Permanent product-parity guard covers native Partner dashboard, verification and matching navigation/contracts.
- `partner.dashboard` and `service_provider.capabilities` moved from `gap` to `required`.

Still explicit Block 7 gaps:

- `service_provider.jobs`: open job feed, quoting, assigned work, start/complete, inspection outcomes and job chat.
- `service_provider.leads`: matched Finance/Warranty inbox, detail and provider responses.
- `service_provider.messages`: provider-focused message workspace/list entry.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 7: Native Partner/provider Jobs

**Block 7 checkpoint:** paid-job provider lifecycle completed on native mobile; Block 7 remains in progress.

Completed in this slice:

- Native Available Jobs and My Work views for Delivery, Recovery and Inspection.
- Matching feed uses the same approved capability/postcode backend filters as web.
- Cursor pagination, pull-to-refresh and provider capability empty/error states.
- Provider quote create/update/withdraw using the authoritative TradeXchange job endpoints.
- Assigned job lifecycle: accepted → customer paid → start → complete → payout/release state.
- Full customer contact is only shown when the backend authorizes the assigned provider business.
- Native service-job chat uses `POST /chat/service-jobs/:jobId` and reuses the existing ChatScreen/realtime room.
- Inspection completion preserves structured `PASS` / `FAULTS_FOUND` outcomes; faulted inspections require a written summary, maintaining the Block 5 auction-refusal contract.
- `service_provider.jobs` moved from `gap` to `required` in `product-parity.json`.
- Permanent parity checks now fail if native job feed, quote/start/complete, structured inspection or service-job chat contracts disappear.

Still explicit Block 7 gaps:

- `service_provider.leads`: matched Finance/Warranty inbox, detail and provider responses.
- `service_provider.messages`: provider-focused message workspace/list entry.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 7: Native Partner/provider Leads

**Block 7 checkpoint:** Finance/Warranty provider lead parity completed on native mobile; Block 7 remains in progress.

Completed in this slice:

- Native matched-enquiry inbox for Finance and Warranty providers.
- All / Finance / Warranty filtering, cursor pagination and pull-to-refresh.
- Matched lead detail exposes the same consented customer contact and vehicle information as web.
- Finance requirements: deposit, preferred term, monthly budget, employment status and annual income.
- Warranty requirements: requested duration and cover level.
- Provider response create/update supports headline, product/plan, message and indicative price.
- Finance responses additionally support representative APR and finance term months.
- Existing provider responses are pre-filled for update rather than creating a second response path.
- `service_provider.leads` moved from `gap` to `required` in `product-parity.json`.
- Permanent parity checks now fail if the native matched inbox/detail or provider response contract disappears.

Still explicit Block 7 gap:

- `service_provider.messages`: provider-focused message workspace/list entry.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 7: Native Partner/provider Messages

**Block 7 checkpoint:** Partner/TradeXchange provider journey completed on native mobile.

Completed in this slice:

- Native chat rooms now expose the existing shared `SERVICE_JOB` context and service-job metadata already used by web.
- Partner Account has a dedicated Service Job Messages workspace for approved Delivery/Inspection providers.
- Provider Messages filters the shared room collection to service-job conversations instead of creating a second messaging backend.
- Conversation rows show customer, service/job title, job/payment status, unread count and latest message.
- Search and pull-to-refresh operate on the shared room list.
- Opening a provider conversation reuses the normal native `ChatScreen`, preserving the existing message, attachment, read-state and realtime behaviour.
- Permanent product-parity guard covers service-job room metadata, provider filtering, Partner navigation and shared ChatScreen reuse.
- `service_provider.messages` moved from `gap` to `required`.

**Block 7 result:** `partner.dashboard`, `service_provider.capabilities`, `service_provider.jobs`, `service_provider.leads` and `service_provider.messages` are now represented on web and native mobile. No explicit Partner/provider UI gap remains in Block 7.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 8: Payments, HPI, chat and notifications complete

**Programme checkpoint:** Blocks 1–8 have now reached the business-rule parity checkpoint.

Completed/audited in Block 8:

- **Notification and chat routing (#217):**
  - Expo push payloads carry canonical `type`, entity/action metadata, link/data and notification id.
  - In-app notification taps, foreground/background responses and cold-start push taps share one native resolver.
  - Cold-start routing waits for authentication/navigation readiness and falls back to Notifications rather than dropping the tap.
  - Push taps mark the persisted notification read.
  - Direct-open chat refreshes room state once when a newly created service-job/support room has not reached ChatContext yet.
  - Required parity surfaces: `notifications.tap_routing` and `chat.direct_open`.

- **Hosted Checkout reconciliation ownership (#218):**
  - `session-status`, auction-fee, KYC, HPI and HPI-email recovery paths now receive the authenticated user id.
  - A Stripe Checkout session id is no longer sufficient by itself to read/reconcile a payment.
  - Personal/HPI/TradeXchange sessions remain exact-user.
  - Explicit dealership delegation is limited to the existing RBAC contract: auction fee, listing fee, owner-only KYC and Featured Boost inventory authority.
  - Native auction PaymentIntent reconciliation remains transaction/metadata-bound and unchanged.

- **Seller £100 reward settlement (#220):**
  - Handover approval uses an atomic false → true claim.
  - Stripe settlement uses `claim:seller-bonus:<auctionId>` plus the stable idempotency key `auction-seller-bonus-<auctionId>`.
  - Stripe rejection releases the claim; Stripe-success/DB-finalization ambiguity retains it for a safe retry.
  - Retained claims remain visible in Pending Payouts.
  - Manual payout cannot race a Stripe claim/transfer.
  - Admin messaging explicitly directs ambiguous Stripe cases to idempotent retry before any manual payment.

- **TradeXchange provider payouts audited:**
  - Paid-job release already uses an atomic payment claim (`claim:release:<paymentId>`) and stable Stripe idempotency key.
  - A failed Stripe transfer releases the claim; a post-Stripe DB failure deliberately retains it for safe retry.
  - Provider readiness is refreshed from Stripe before accepting new paid work and checks the transfer capability actually needed by separate charges/transfers.

- **Stripe Connect audited:**
  - Seller/Partner onboarding is user-owned and reuses the same Express account.
  - Seller status checks the full set of capabilities requested for seller accounts.
  - Provider paid-work readiness deliberately does not require provider-side card charging because CarMazium creates the customer charge on the platform account.

- **HPI purchase/entitlement audit:**
  - Listing-level HPI reports are authenticated shared listing content once purchased/prepared.
  - Mobile can purchase the listing-level £9.99 report and uses the same summary/PDF backend.
  - Web additionally offers a separate buyer-specific £9.99 emailed-copy service; its request state is keyed to the current buyer and its Checkout fallback is ownership-bound.
  - This difference is an intentional delivery product, not a report-access parity gap.
  - Required parity surface: `hpi.report_entitlements`.

- **Payment client parity represented:**
  - `payments.checkout_reconciliation` covers hosted web recovery and native PaymentIntent reconciliation.
  - `payments.seller_bonus_payout` covers seller-facing reward state across web/native while backend settlement remains exactly-once.

**Block 8 result:** Stripe/Connect, seller/provider payout lifecycle, HPI entitlements, realtime chat, notifications and tap routing have been audited against the authoritative backend. No explicit Block 8 business-rule gap remains.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 9: Native customer service-job reachability

**Block 9 checkpoint:** the explicit native buyer auction-inspection/refusal gap is closed; Block 9 remains in progress.

Implemented:
- Added native customer service-job API coverage for linked auction inspections, customer job listing/detail, quote acceptance, completion confirmation, dispute/cancel and review contracts.
- Added `CustomerServiceJobsScreen` and `CustomerServiceJobDetailScreen`.
- Services hub now exposes **My service jobs**.
- Native deep links resolve `/services/jobs` and `/services/jobs/:jobId`.
- A paid auction winner can choose **Inspect Before Handover**; the backend returns the existing active linked inspection if one already exists, preventing duplicate jobs.
- Customer job detail compares active provider quotes, opens secure hosted checkout, exposes provider contact/chat after payment, shows structured inspection outcome and supports completion/dispute/cancel.
- A completed/released linked inspection with `FAULTS_FOUND` exposes **Refuse Vehicle & Refund £125**, calling the same verified backend refusal contract as web.
- `buyer.auction_inspection_refusal` moved from `gap` to `required` in `product-parity.json`.
- Product parity CI now verifies the full native reachability chain: Services hub → customer jobs → linked inspection → verified-fault refusal.

Still open in Block 9:
- Cross-role navigation/back-stack certification beyond this customer service journey.
- Theme/terminology parity pass.
- Loading/empty/error/offline consistency audit.
- Accessibility and performance checks.
- `admin.operations` remains the only manifest `gap`; final treatment belongs to Block 10 certification because the native product does not currently expose an admin application.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 9: Native public detail deep links and back stack

**Checkpoint:** vehicle and auction public URLs are now safe native entry points; Block 9 remains in progress.

Implemented:
- Added lightweight `VehicleDeepLinkScreen` and `AuctionDeepLinkScreen` hydrators.
- `/buy-cars/:slug` resolves the backend listing first, then opens `VehicleDetail`.
- `/auctions/live/:auctionId` resolves the auction and uses the shared `auctionToListingParam` adapter before opening `LiveAuctionDetailed`.
- Both cold-start wrappers reset the stack to `Tabs → Detail`, so Back returns to the native app rather than exiting from a one-screen deep-link stack.
- React Navigation linking now maps those two public website routes instead of intentionally excluding them.
- iOS app config declares `applinks:carmazium.com` and `applinks:www.carmazium.com`.
- Android app config declares verified HTTPS intent paths for the currently supported CarMazium web routes.
- Added required parity surface `navigation.public_detail_deeplinks` and a CI guard for hydration + back-stack behavior.

External production prerequisite:
- The repository does not contain the Apple Team/app identifier needed for `apple-app-site-association` or the Android release signing SHA-256 fingerprint needed for `.well-known/assetlinks.json`.
- Those values must come from the real App Store / EAS signing credentials. They were deliberately not guessed. Universal-link/App-Link verification cannot be certified until the website association files are published with those real identifiers.

Still open in Block 9:
- Cross-role navigation/back-stack audit beyond public detail links and customer service jobs.
- Theme/terminology parity.
- Loading/empty/error/offline consistency.
- Accessibility and performance certification.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 9: Cross-role navigation and authenticated back stack

**Checkpoint:** buyer/seller/dealer/partner drawer targets are registered and authenticated dashboard deep links retain a usable native back stack. Block 9 remains in progress.

Audit findings:
- All current GlobalDrawer `stackScreen` targets resolve to registered `MainStackNavigator` screens.
- Buyer Dashboard had one real dead route: **Make an Offer** called `navigation.navigate('Search')`, but Search is a child of Tabs rather than a MainStack route.
- Authenticated dashboard URLs in `linking.ts` targeted MainStack screens directly without a linked-state initial route, allowing a cold-started linked screen to become the only MainStack entry.

Implemented:
- Buyer Dashboard now routes **Make an Offer** through `Tabs → Search`.
- The linked Main stack declares `initialRouteName: 'Tabs'`, preserving a home/back destination beneath linked Notifications, Messages, Settings, services and dashboard screens.
- Added required parity surface `navigation.cross_role_backstack`.
- Product parity CI now parses every GlobalDrawer `stackScreen` target and fails if it is not registered in MainStack.
- Product parity CI also rejects direct top-level Buyer Dashboard Search navigation or removal of the linked Tabs initial route.

Still open in Block 9:
- Theme and terminology parity.
- Loading / empty / error / offline consistency.
- Accessibility and performance certification.
- Universal-link/App-Link website association files still require the real Apple app identifier and Android signing SHA-256 fingerprint.

## 2026-09-23 — Block 9: Shared dealer and Partner terminology

**Checkpoint:** equivalent dealer/Partner features now use the same visible names across web and native. Block 9 remains in progress.

Audit findings:
- Web dealer navigation already uses the simplified product language: **Stock**, **Customers**, **Offers**, **Purchases**, **Team**, **Finance**, **Analytics**, **Service Jobs** and **Service Enquiries**.
- Native dealer navigation still exposed implementation-oriented labels such as **Dealer inventory**, **Dealer leads**, **Direct offers**, **Team Management** and **Finance applications**.
- The Partner provider journey used **Partner Jobs** / **Matched Enquiries** on native while web used **Service Jobs** / **Finance & Warranty Enquiries**.
- The web Partner dashboard route label said **Partner Services** even though the product and page itself use **Partner Account**.

Implemented:
- Native dealer drawer now uses **Manage Auctions**, **Customers**, **Stock**, **Saved Cars**, **Analytics**, **Team**, **Offers**, **My Retail Offers** and **Finance**.
- Native CRM page title is **Customers** and its top-level empty/create/message copy now uses customer-facing language while internal lead-status/API terminology stays unchanged.
- Native received-offers title is **Offers Received**.
- Web Partner route label/title is **Partner Account**.
- Native Partner cards and provider screens now use **Service Jobs** and **Finance & Warranty Enquiries** consistently with web.
- Added required parity surface `ui.shared_terminology`.
- Product parity CI now fails if these shared visible terms drift across the clients.

Still open in Block 9:
- Loading / empty / error / offline consistency.
- Accessibility and performance certification.
- Universal-link/App-Link website association files still require the real Apple app identifier and Android signing SHA-256 fingerprint.

## 2026-09-24 — Block 9: Performance hardening checkpoint

**Checkpoint:** static web/native performance risks identified in the repository are hardened and CI-guarded. Runtime/device certification remains deliberately separate.

Audit evidence:
- Native bundles only eight checked-in image assets, but the three onboarding backgrounds total about 3.9 MB of the ~4.15 MB checked-in mobile asset payload.
- The onboarding FlatList had no render-window limits, so its default virtualization window could mount/decode all three full-screen backgrounds during the first-run journey.
- The Android release recipe documents a typical ~65–68 MB APK, while `expo-build-properties` still disabled ProGuard and resource shrinking even though the project already carries explicit Expo/R8 keep rules.
- Web already code-split Mazium with `next/dynamic`, but the loader mounted immediately in the root layout, so the assistant chunk could still compete with first navigation/paint work.
- Web image optimization remains intentionally disabled because account-level Vercel `/_next/image` quota failures previously broke marketplace photos. This checkpoint does not trade reliability for a synthetic image-optimization score.

Implemented:
- Mazium now mounts after `requestIdleCallback` (with a bounded fallback) instead of competing with first paint.
- Native onboarding uses `expo-image` and limits the horizontal FlatList to one initial item / one item per batch with a small render window and Android clipping.
- `assetBundlePatterns` is narrowed to `assets/**/*`.
- Android release builds enable ProGuard/R8 and resource shrinking, retaining the existing `expo.modules.kotlin` / Expo-module keep rules.
- Added required parity surface `ui.performance_baseline`.
- Product parity CI now rejects removal of the idle-load, onboarding virtualization or Android release-shrinking safeguards.

Still requires release/runtime evidence:
- Build a signed release APK/AAB on the configured Android build machine and record before/after artifact size.
- Run the first-run onboarding and core scrolling journeys on a physical Android device, watching memory pressure/jank.
- Measure production/preview Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) with browser tooling after deployment.
- Run screen-reader/browser accessibility verification on real runtime surfaces.
- Universal/App Link certification still requires the real Apple app identifier and Android signing SHA-256 fingerprint for the website association files.

## 2026-09-24 — Block 10: Code-parity release certification

**Checkpoint:** code-contract parity is closed; runtime release evidence remains conditional.

Manifest result:
- 49 required web/native parity surfaces.
- 2 approved web-only surfaces.
- 0 unresolved `gap` entries.
- 0 unresolved `web_only_candidate` entries.

Approved web-only boundaries:
- `admin.operations`: privileged internal back-office tooling remains in the authenticated web admin console; native has no ADMIN application surface.
- `blog.seo`: public SEO/content surface, accessible through the website, with no app-specific transactional behaviour.

Release-gate changes:
- Product parity CI now fails on any future `gap`, candidate-only exception, unknown status, missing required surface or undocumented/invalid web-only exception.
- Performance-sensitive config paths (`next.config.ts`, native `app.json`, native Expo plugins) now trigger the parity workflow.
- Final report added at `docs/parity/FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md`.

Runtime/external evidence still required before a specific release is called fully certified:
- signed Android APK/AAB build and size delta after R8/resource shrinking;
- physical-device memory/jank journey pass;
- production Core Web Vitals/browser performance measurement;
- runtime keyboard/screen-reader checks;
- real Apple app identifier and Android release-certificate SHA-256 for website association files.



### 2026-09-25 — Block 10 release certification

**Rebased certification baseline:** `main@cc568dec50fbcfba5acb4bbc4cca2fe0ad8e732e`, including PR #250 Registered Company / Sole Trader Partner/dealer KYC.

**Repository result.** The manifest now has 54 required web/native features, 2 approved web-only exceptions and zero unresolved gaps. The sole-trader KYC branch is explicitly represented and CI-guarded rather than only inheriting generic dealer coverage. Added `scripts/check-release-readiness.mjs` and `.github/workflows/release-certification.yml` so product parity, release config, web/native/backend type safety, full backend tests/build and native Expo config are evaluated together.

**Production evidence.** Current-main Vercel deployment `dpl_7LVPAMqfm8LupJj9GXwEvCNmgieE` was READY with a clean build error view. Core public routes returned HTTP 200 after the KYC merge. In the inspected first-hour window the deployment recorded 13 HTTP 200 and 2 HTTP 304 responses, with no 4xx/5xx status groups and no warning/error/fatal log entries.

**External release blockers.** Both `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` and `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` return 404. The actual Android signing fingerprint and Apple Team/app identifier are not stored in the repository, and the iOS EAS submit values remain placeholders. No signed store artefact or physical-device pass is claimed.

**Programme state:** Blocks 1–10 complete at the code-contract/live-web level. Native store release remains on HOLD until the strict external gate can pass.


### 2026-10-01 — TX pass logged (TradeXchange) — not an audit

29 rows added to `PARITY-MATRIX.md` as `TX-001`..`TX-029`, plus `CROSS-027` (Home entry point).
The matrix had no TradeXchange rows before this.

- **9 `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`** (TX-001..009): code written this session (commits `b8d37b40`, `319c1d73`),
  checked only by reading against the backend DTOs/controllers and web; **never run on a device**.
- **20 `UNAUDITED`** (TX-010..029): the rest of the TradeXchange surface. New status, makes no claim
  about mobile. Web column is the route path only. Pick these up with a real trace (UI → nav → API → render).
- Checked this session: `npx tsc --noEmit` (only the 4 missing-module errors from this machine's
  incomplete `node_modules`) and `node scripts/check-product-parity.mjs` (passes).
- Device checklist: `docs/MOBILE_TRADEXCHANGE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Things seen but not resolved, kept in the rows rather than fixed: Stripe Connect return URL points at
  the website (TX-023); `notificationRouting.ts` has no service/lead/job lines (TX-027); Home chip stays
  visible when a service is paused (CROSS-027).
